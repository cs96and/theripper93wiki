3D Canvas
ModuleInfo />
3D Canvas is a module for viewing and creating maps in 3D.
Turn your maps into true 3D, load in 3D models, and play your games in
the glorious third dimension. Supports lighting and animated models. If
you don't have 3D models don't worry! 3D canvas will turn your 2D
tokens into stand-up figures in 3D mode.

 Incompatible Modules
There are no known modules that will cause issues.
However, modules that create visual effects in 2D will likely not carry over
effects to 3D. Other types of modules will likely be compatible with 3D Canvas.
 Tools

    The 3D navigator is a new way for you and your players to navigate the
    3D Scene with ease!
    To have the 3D Navigator show a slider with all it's options, you must
    define Levels in the Levels UI. The navigator will use those names and
    the top range for its clipping planes
    To cut to a specific Level, simply move the slider to the Level you
    prefer, the slider will automatically snap to the closest Level.
    - Sync:
    If you are a GM, you will see a Sync button on top of the slider, by pressing
    the button you will sync your current level with all players.
    - Camera:
    If you are a Player or GM you will see a Camera button, by pressing it
    the camera will focus on the currently selected token (the same as Shift + X ).
    Doing this will automatically set the navigator to the closest level.
    - Follow Mode:
    Click to toggle. Selecting a token or changing elevation will automatically
    set the navigator to the closest level while enabled. It is enabled on scene
    load for players and disabled for GMs by default. You can change this behaviour in the module settings under the misc tab.

          to set the camera before saving the initial view position.
          Lock Camera Perspective
          If you wish to force a certain perspective on this scene, you can lock
          it. The camera will no longer rotate, the angle for the lock is the one
          of the initial view position.
        
        
          HDRI
          If no skybox is selected, the HDRI will be used as the background. if
          both skybox and HDRI are selected, the skybox will be used as the
          background and the HDRI for lighting and reflections. Having and HDRI is
          highly suggested for Metallic and Reflective surfaces to look correct.
          Skybox Image
          Set the skybox (or 3D background) for this scene. The file needs to be
          in the same folder of 6 total files, files must contain
          `_ft`, `_bk`, `_up`, `_dn`,
          `_rt`, or `_lf` in their name.
          Enable Bloom
          Toggles bloom effects for the scene.
          Filter
          Adds filter effects to the scene. Available filters are
          `Greyscale`
          `Sepia`
          `Invert`
          `Contrast`
          `Brightness`
          `Hue`
          `Saturation`
          `Custom`
          Custom will create an input box under filter intensity. You can create
          your custom filter with CSS Filters and the syntax will be the same. See
          the  on
          CSS Filter for more information.
        
        
          Particle Preset
          Set the weather or effect for the scene, you can have up of 2 effects at the same
          time and one of them can be custom (Particle Preset 2 has the custom option).
        
        
          Render Walls
          Whether or not to display the 2d Canvas Walls in the 3D Mode.
          Render Doors
          Whether or not to display walls marked as doors.
          Render Tiles
          Whether or not to display tiles.
          Render Scene Lights
          Whether or not to display lights.
          Mirror Levels Tile Visibility
          If enabled 3D Canvas will mirror the Levels tiles visibility. This
          option is required if you want to make a multilevel 3D Map where floors
          above tokens disappear automatically for easier navigation.
          Use 3D Geometry for sight calculations
          Instead of mirroring the 2D Canvas token visibility, use the 3D Geometry
          of the scene. This means that if you simply load a 3D Model into the
          scene, it's geometry will be used to block token visibility, meaning you
          do not need to wall the scene and it will just work. This setting also applies to
          
          Auto Targeting and 3D Cover Calculations.

 Entities in 3D
While most entities will work the same in 3D as they do in 2D, there are some differences that you should be aware of. Especially when dealing with Tiles since they are the most common entity in 3D and can do a lot more than what you are used to in 2D.
For example in 3D we use tiles to create walls, floors, ceilings, and even roofs. Tiles are capable of blocking sight and movement and to be used as doors.
To see details about how to use the various 3D Entities, visit their respective pages. It's suggested to at least read the  page since it's the entity you will be dealing with the most.

 Fog of War
Fog of war works slightly differently in 3D, with the default settings the map will be completely revealed. If you want to know more about how Fog of War works in 3D and it's performance implications and limitations, check the  page.
 Special Effects
 Shaders
Shaders allow you to create many procedural effects on Tiles, Tokens, Templates and more. From simple color changes to complex effects like water, fire, wind, and ice.

 Token Animations
Image src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1346839/168579135-4b6137f7-05a5-4371-9d24-3e0454cf42ab.png' alt='3D Tile Menu'   className={styles.wikiImage} />
 Start an animation through the UI
You can access the Token Animations by Right clicking your token to open the Token Hud, you will see a Magic Wand icon on the right, click it to open the available animations. Clicking on an animation will play the animation for all clients. Some animations might not work if the token is Prone or Defeated.
 Start animation with macros
To play an animation with a macro, first create a script macro, then use the following commands to play your desired animation.
js
game.Levels3DPreview.playTokenAnimation(tokens, animationId, options);
 Parameter   | Description                                                                                                                                                       |
 ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
 tokens      | This parameter can be a single token object, an array of token objects, a single token ID or an array of token IDs, the animation will play on all these targets. |
 animationId | The identifier for the animation, you can find all the animation IDs by typing `game.Levels3DPreview.CONFIG.tokenAnimations` in the console and hitting Enter.    |
 Options     | This is optional, an object containing additional parameters                                                                                                      |
js
  repeats: 1, // How many times you want the animation to play
  resetTime: milliseconds, // Force the time that the animation takes to reset to the original position once it ends
 Example Macro
This macro will play the Twirl animation, 3 Times, on all Selected Tokens
js
game.Levels3DPreview.playTokenAnimation(canvas.tokens.controlled, "twirl", {
    repeats: 3,
 Particle System
3D Canvas includes a particle system meant for spell effects, the system is highly customizable but also very simple to use for basic projectiles.
 No Scripting usage
Image src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1346839/168579424-7dd2436b-7503-46f4-8ea5-ff9a0925d610.png' alt='Automated Animations UI' className={styles.wikiImage} />
If you don't want to dig into the scripting aspect, the module  provides a graphical interface to setup 3D Canvas Particle Effects.
 Advanced usage
If you wish to use the particle system to it's full potential, you can create particle effects by using macros.
You can find the full documentation in the 
 Supported File Formats
Tabs items={['3D File Formats', '2D File Formats', 'PBR Materials']}>
  
    
      Note that FBX support is getting phased out, since it's an inferior and outdated format compared to the new GLTF standard. It's suggested to use GLB\GLTF if possible.
    
    You can use `GLB`, `GLTF` and `FBX` files, other formats can be easily converted. Blender is suggested to perform
    this operation.
  
  
    3D Canvas supports all the file formats supported by Foundry, including
    animated `webm` files. Due to how 3D Canvas handles transparency, semi-transparent images might be completely cut of by the processing.
    While the weather system supports animated file formats, the particle
    effect system does not.
  
  
    Material Browser
    
    If you installed the 3D Canvas Mapmaking Pack, you will have access to more than 1000 Materials and the Material Browser.
    
    To access the material browser simply click the circular icon left of the  icon ().
    You will then be welcomed by the material browser. To apply the material simply click on the desired one. Keep in mind that if you intend to use these materials on tokens, you need to select PBR in the material
    option.
    Manually Loading a PBR Material
    Tokens, walls, tiles and the scene table support PBR Materials. To load a pbr material you need a specific file naming stuctures. The files must be named as follows and be all in the same folder.
    ```postcss
    Wood0771KAmbientOcclusion.jpg
    Wood0771KColor.jpg
    Wood0771KEmissive.jpg
    Wood0771KMetalness.jpg
    Wood0771KNormalGL.jpg
    Wood0771KRoughness.jpg
    ```
    As you can see all the files share a root name then keywords to differentiate the different textures.
    You need to select one of the files in the image field to use them in 3D Canvas.
    
      For the full material to be loaded you can pick any of the images but not
      color, otherwise only the color texture will be used.
    
    For walls you can load the image in it's texture field, same for tokens, tiles and the scene table. Tokens also require that the material is set to PBR.
    Displacement maps are not supported due to performance and optimization.

    _A guide by `@simulacrum`
    - Go to 
      - Upload you image. It doesn't take EXR so you'll have to convert those to HDRI, PNG or JPEG.
    - Once it's uploaded it will appear in the 3D view. You can now see how the Cube map will look.
    - It's possible to move the image by dragging on it butdon'tor it won't line up with your HDRI.
    - Adjust the Exposure. Make it darker.
    - The HDRI lights the cube map so you will have to compensate for this, either now or in your image editor later.
      - Choose Export and choose the bottom option export as PNG choosing the size you want for the individual sides
    - 2k is normally enough but you can try 4k if your machine can handle it or 1k if not
      - Click Process
      - Once it's finished, download them
    - The names of the files don't match up with 3D Canvas so use a file renamer to swap them.
    - Remember that your prefix must match on every file (i.e. name_bk , name_ft , etc.)
    - All the images will need to be flipped horizontally.
    - You will also have to rotate the \_up and \_dn images clockwise 90 degrees.
    - Altering the images in an editor like Photoshop or Gimp is recommended.
    - Save all of the files.
    - You can get the file size down by changing them to JPEG
    - Don't use much, if any, compression as it shows.
      webp looks very compressed so I don't use it.
      That's it. You now have an 8bit cube map that matches you 32 bit HDRI that will be a much smaller file size that the equivalent HDRI. Now you can use a 1k HDRI to give you the lighting and reflections and use the 8bit Cube Map as the background image.

 Your First Levels Map
While Levels is capable of handling full multilevel maps, we will start
with something simple: Adding a multilevel barn to an existing map.
This approach is scalable to any map you might want to build in the future.
div className='steps-container-ol'>
1. Open any scene or create a new scene and set a background. This
   tutorial assumes you have a standard grid size of 5ft, if that is
   not the case adjust the Levels size accordingly (usually 2 times the
   size of 1 square). Setting a background is not strictly required and
   you can use a blank map if you prefer.
2. Open the Levels UI (also known as the Levels Layer Tool) by
   pressing the  button.
3. Press the  button to go into edit mode, extend
   the window vertically to have some extra space
4. Press the  button two times to add two levels.
5. Set the bottom one at 0/10 elevation and the top one at 10/20. Name
   your Levels `Ground Floor` and `First Floor`. Giving a name to your
   Levels is not strictly required.
6. Head out of edit mode by pressing the button again and select the
   0/10 Level by clicking on it. Your UI should now match the Levels UI
   screenshot below.
7. While you have a Level selected in the UI, anything you place will
   be placed on that Level. Now head to the `Tiles Layer`.
8. Open the `Tile Browser` and navigate to
   `modules/levels/sample-maps/baileywiki/`, drag and drop the
   `barn-lvl1.webp` file onto the scene.
9. Head to the `Walls Layer` and wall this ground floor tile
   appropriately.
10. Now select the First Floor (10/20) in the Levels UI. In the `Tile
Browser` grab the `barn-lvl2.webp` file from the same folder and
    drag it on top of the other tile aligning them correctly. As
    before, head to the `Walls Layer` and wall this floor
    appropriately.
11. We will enable an additional settings on this floor so we can see it
    when we are on the Ground Floor. Double click the First Floor tile
    to open it's configuration, head to the Levels Tab and enable `Show
Even When Below?` and save your changes
12. Let's add a roof! Toggle roof view/placement by clicking 
13. Drag and drop the roof tile `barn-roof.webp` is in the correct position
14. Head back to the Ground Floor with the Roof mode still enabled and
    place `barn-shed-roof.webp` on top of the shed on the left side of
    the barn.
15. Last step is connecting the floors. Toggle the Roof View/Placement
    off, and on the ground floor head to the `Drawings Layer`
16. Place a square drawing where the ladder is located on the top of the
    barn. This will create a stair.
17. Done! Place a token and move around to explore the barn.
div>
Remember to use Tokens with vision and have vision enabled in the scene
settings!
Feel free to play with multiple tokens (selecting one at
a time) to see how floors block vision.
While we don't have stairs to connect us to the roofs,
you can manually change the elevation of your tokens to 10 or 20 to explore them.
Maybe experiment by creating your own star connections to the roofs\!
 Basics
Callout type='warning' emoji='⚠️'>
  When using Levels it's important to understand the concept of [Wall Height's
  Token Height](../free/wall-height#token-height) make sure to read the
  documentation about it before using Levels.

 Levels UI
Image
  src='/images/Levels/Levels_UI.png'
  alt='A screenshot of the Levels UI'
  className={styles.wikiImage}
Open the Levels UI (also known as the Levels Layer Tool) by pressing the  button.
You will see a small semi-transparent black box open in the top-right of
Foundry.
Layers can be manually created with the  button on the
bottom of the row or automatically generated from entities with
elevation values with the  button on the bottom row.
While the Levels UI is open, the view will show all tiles and entities
in the elevation range of the layer. Any tiles or tokens added to the
scene while on a layer in the UI will automatically set the tile or
token to its height.
To rename or change the elevation values of a layer, press the
FontAwesomeIcon icon={faPenToSquare} /> button. You will now be in edit mode for
the Levels UI window. Click on the layer you wish to edit, then modify the name or
values. The downwards arrow represents the lowest elevation and the upwards arrow
represents the highest for the layer. Click the button again to confirm and save
your edit.
There are 3 additional toggles at the leftmost of the bottom row:
FontAwesomeIcon icon={faUsers} /> Show Players in the UI
Shows icons of the players in the UI, the icons will be placed in the
corresponding level. You can click the icons to select the corresponding
player.
FontAwesomeIcon icon={faSortAmountUpAlt} /> Place Drawings as Stairs
While toggled on, place drawings as stairs, toggle it off to create
labels or descriptions to place in your levels.
FontAwesomeIcon icon={faArchway} /> Enable Levels Roofs View/Placement
Displays roofs above the current level. Placing tiles while this toggle
is active will place them as roofs above the current level.
FontAwesomeIcon icon={faTree} /> Place Tiles as Overhead Tiles Inside the Current
Level
Tiles placed with this toggle active will be placed as overhead tiles
inside the level. For example you could use this to place a chandelier
inside the current level.
To view every tile and token or exit the layers view, close the Levels
UI. You can also clear all levels layers with the 
button. This will not delete tiles or tokens.
If you create a drawing while the Levels UI is active, the drawing will
be set automatically as a Stair and it will be set as Hidden. The Stair
will be configured to move you from the current Level to the one above
it and vice versa.
The Levels UI is a tool to help you place and visualize your Levels
setup. Levels does not require levels in the UI to be defined to work,
for example if you deleted all your levels in the UI after building your
map, the map will still work exactly the same. Removing levels from the
UI or changing their range will not modify or remove entities in the
scene.
 Tiles
Tiles are a core aspect of Levels. Every tile can be assigned an
elevation and sight is based on tile transparency.
It is generally recommended for Levels tiles to be overhead tiles. Tiles
not set as overhead will all be placed at the background elevation.
The background is counted as a solid plane (i.e. a single overhead tile
at a defined elevation) with a default elevation of 0. The elevation of
the background can be adjusted in scene settings. Keep in mind that the
background layer and it's tiles will not account for transparency and
will count instead as a solid scene sized plane.
 Tokens
Token height is handled by .
It's highly suggested to read the `Token Height` section of the Wall Height page
before using Levels.
 Drawings
Image
  src='/images/Levels/Drawingconfigmenu.png'
  alt='Config Menu'
  className={styles.wikiImage}
In Levels, drawings are used to create stairs and elevators. Their purpose is to
allow travel between elevations. However, how they handle travel between elevations
is handled differently.
To create or edit a stair or elevator, double click on an existing
drawing to open the drawing configuration menu.
You will see a few settings added by Levels.
Levels Drawing Mode` determines the purpose of the drawing. `None`
treats it as a vanilla Foundry drawing, `Stair` sets it as a stair, and
Elevator` sets it as an elevator.
One Way Stairs` follow the same rules as regular Stairs but work only
One Way
Before V10, there was the `Hole` option as well. However, holes have
been deprecated from V10 onwards in favour of tile transparency.
Elevator Floors` set the floors an elevator can transport entities
between. The syntax for it is `elevation,name|elevation,name` (e.g.
0,Ground Floor|10, First Floor`).
Height (Top)` sets the top height (i.e. highest point) of the drawing.
Height (Bottom)` sets the bottom height (i.e. lowest point) of the
drawing.
 Stairs
Stairs allow tokens to travel from and to two set elevations.
 Stairs can only move tokens to its set elevations
 The token must be on one of the two elevations exactly (e.g. 0 or 10) to trigger
 Stairs will move tokens one value higher than its top elevation if
  entering from below
For example: a stair with a bottom of 0 and a top of 9. A token at an elevation
of 0 that enters the stair will now have an elevation of 10.
If they re-enter the stair while at an elevation of 10, they will then have an
elevation of 0. Any other elevation will not trigger the Stair.
 One Way Stairs
One way stairs function the same way as regular stairs but don't allow
two-way movement.
For example: a one way stair with a bottom of 0 and a top of 9.
If set to `One Way - Down` will bring any token that enters it while at an
elevation of 10 to 0,
and entering with an elevation of 0 will do nothing. `One Way - Up` will do the opposite
 Elevators
Elevators allow tokens to travel between multiple set elevations.
Tokens that enter an elevator can freely travel between the elevations
set in `Elevator Floors` via a pop-up menu.
Elevators will trigger on any elevation in the range of the drawing. For
example an elevator set to 0 / 40 as it's top and bottom values will
trigger on any elevation between those (e.g. 25). The options you define
in the elevator don't affect the triggering range.
 Vision
Callout type='info' emoji='ℹ️'>
  Levels heavily relies on vision. If vision is disabled on the map or you have
  selected a token without vision, you might experience undesired effects\!
Callout>
Image
  src='/images/Levels/Howsightwork.jpg'
  alt='A simple diagram visualizing sight concepts'
  className={styles.wikiImage}
Token vision is best understood three dimensionally ala our own physical world.
Imagine 3 tokens. Let's call them Token A, B, and C. Token
A is on top of a tower that is 60 units high. Tokens B and C
are at an elevation of 0.
However, Token B is 60 (horizontal) units away from Token A and
Token C is 10 (horizontal) units away from Token A.
Token A can see farther outwards than Tokens B and C because
it is viewing from a higher vantage point. It will also be able to look
over any tiles at an elevation of less than 60. In addition, Token A
and Token B can see each other.
However, Token A and Token C cannot see each other. This is
because the line of sight between Token B and Token C is blocked
by the tower. If Token C moves farther away from Token A and the
tower, then the two tokens will be visible to each other.
 Fog of War & Advanced Fog Exploration
Fog in foundry is unidimensional, the system itself is not build to
handle multiple layers of fog, for that reason, by default, if you
explored any elevation, all areas in that zone (independent of
elevation) will also be explored. For example if a player explored a
first floor of a building then went to the second floor, it would be
already fully explored.
Since the only way to make it work correctly would be to completely
rewrite the fog exploration system and even then there would be issues
of storing multiple fogs (as it would take up load time on startup).
Outside of this problem there would be even more issues because 'fog
layers' could not be completely separate as exploring an area open to
the sky would make it dark once you changed elevation.
Due to all this issues that currently have no solution levels implements
what's called 'Advanced Fog Exploration'.
What this does is simple, when a player is in the elevation range of a
tile, levels imposes a black shape of that tile onto the fog layer which
basically means that it disables fog exploration for that tile only.
Unfortunately there is no solution currently to solve this problem.
This is enabled by default, but you can globally disable it or even
toggle it per tile.
 Settings
 Scene Settings
 Don't disable lights
Callout type='warning' emoji='⚠️'>
  Due to V11 changes that locked down some APIs and Methods, the old Light Masking is no longer working as of V11.
  The setting has been replaced with a new `Don't disable lights` setting.
Callout>
If you don't wish to read below or you find it confusing, the short version is: In scenes that use Levels, you should disable this setting, otherwise leave it as is (enabled by default).
Image
  src='/images/Levels/LightMaskingFine.jpg'
  alt='In this example the lighting looks correct at first glance'
  className={styles.wikiImage}
In this example the lighting looks correct at first glance. `Don't disable lights` can
be toggled in the `Lighting` tab in the scene settings. By enabling this feature
all lights will be visible and pass through all levels.
Disabling this setting will only show lights on the current level. Here we can
see, by moving the roof slightly, that while the roof is covering the "green"
coloration of the light, the vision portion of the light is still visible.
Image
  src='/images/Levels/Lightmaskingbroken.jpg'
  alt='the vision portion of the light is still visible in this screenshot'
  className={styles.wikiImage}
 With this option enabled, lights will be visible and pass through all
  levels.
 While this visual "glitch" will reveal the map in those locations,
  it will not reveal tokens.
 Weather Elevation
Elevation for weather can be adjusted
 Background Elevation
You can set the elevation for the background layer in the scene
settings. Default is 0.
Keep in mind that due to limitations and performance issues, the whole
Background layer will disregard any transparency vision calculations,
and count as a scene-sized vision blocking plane.
Example: If you make a blank new scene with no tiles or background
image, then place a token at 0 elevation and one at -10 you will notice
that they cannot see each other.
This works well for most use cases (e.g. have your map as the background
of the scene, then add floors above and\\or basements below) but might
be a problem in some specific scenes that require transparency at 0
elevation.
In these cases, simply set the Background Elevation to an arbitrary
large negative number (e.g. -99999), ignore the background layer and just
use overhead tiles placed through the Levels UI. For example, after
creating your scene with your background image (so that the scene is
auto sized properly) remove the background image from the scene
configuration and set the background elevation to -99999. Then place
your "background" image through the Levels UI at 0 elevation.
 Handling Multiple Tokens
When having multiple tokens selected, Levels needs to decide a single
point of view, for this reason, multiple tokens handling is not
supported.
While having multiple tokens selected will still merge their vision,
Levels will not be able to decide which floor to show if the tokens are
at different elevations. At the moment there is no solution to this so
stick with one selected token at a time if you have multiple at
different elevations.
 API
The API is available for viewing by entering `CONFIG.Levels.API` in the Foundry
console or in .
 Hooks
levelsInit(levelsConfig)`
A hook that fires when levels has finished initializing, you should use
this hook if you want to subclass/wrap/override the levels handlers
levelsConfig.handlers. This fires before the levels Wrappers are
registered, giving you a chance to wrap or change said functions.
levelsReady(levelsConfig)`
A hook that fires after levels has initialized all it's classes and
register wrappers and hooks.
levelsUiChangeLevel()`
A hook that fires when a different level is selected in the Levels
Layers Tool, you can access the Layers Tool in CONFIG.Levels.UI
levelsPerspectiveChanged(currentToken)`
A hook that fires when the token that Levels is using to render the
current point of view changes. Can be `null` for GMs when no token is
selected.
 Overrides
Levels overrides `MeasuredTemplate#_refreshRulerText`,
Wall#identifyInteriorState,` `DetectionMode#_testRange` and
CanvasOcclusionMask#_identifyOccludedTiles` if your module or system
overrides them as well, there could be conflicts.
If you wish to Override or Wrap the overrides you can do so in the
levelsInit(levelsConfig)` hook.
 Other
 Broken Vision \ Non working Walls
A rare occurence can happen where the vision completely breaks in the scene, producing "ghost" walls and\or non functional walls.
Note that his issue can happen without Levels as well, but the way we build overlapping walls with Levels makes it more likely.
If you encounter this issue, disabling Levels will show that the issue persists.
This issue is under investigation, the running theory is that the Foundry wall optimization algorithm is not working properly when the scene has a lot of stacked walls.
First, remove any walls around the edges of the map if you have any. If the issue is not fixed, enaable Levels, then offset all the walls on each layer by a small amount so that their end points don't overlap with other walls on other levels.
I'm currently in contact with the developer that wrote the wall optimization algorithm to see if there is a way to fix this issue.
 Foundry V9 to V10 Changes
 Changes
 Polygons and holes are deprecated
  - Levels will now automatically handle visibility based on the
    tile transparency. You can leave old holes in your maps, they
    simply won't do anything.
  is no longer a required
  dependency
 Light masking is now better but the  module is highly recommended.
 New `Allow Sight` option for tiles. If enabled on a tile, the tile
  will not block sight.
 New `Background Elevation` option in scene configuration. The background is now a Levels entity with a default elevation of 0.
  - This means you can now go under the background.
 New `Weather Elevation` option in scene settings. Allows for changing the elevation of weather effects.
 UI Revamp
  - Scene controls no longer have buttons
  - UI now has all the required buttons
  - Bug button removed
 Top Elevation Collision
  - Tiles will now only perform collision checks at their bottom

Automated Evocations
ModuleInfo />
Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  For the module to work correctly, players need world level permission to create tokens.
Callout>
A user interface to manage companions with summoning animations and
automated summoning for spells.
The Companion Manager works on all Systems, while the automations only work on DnD5e, PF2E.
To configure automations on other systems check .
The module includes a Macro and Actor compendium with preconfigured summons.
 How to use
Image
  src='/images/Automated-Evocations/Aeheaderbtn.png'
  alt='Companion manger button'
  className={styles.wikiImage}
 Companion Manager
Open any character sheet, in the header of the window you will see the companions button
Upon opening you will be welcomed by a window, from here you can drag and drop actors from the sidebar or compendiums into it to add them.
After adding actor to the window you will have some options:
Image
  src='/images/Automated-Evocations/Companionmanager.png'
  alt='Companion Manager Window'
  className={styles.wikiImage}
 To Summon : click on the actor image, you will get a placement croshair, just click where you want to summon the token
 Number field: how many tokens you will spawn
 Animation: The dropdown will let you chose the summoning animation
 Store companions on actor
By default companions are stored per user (so each actor will have the same summon list).
You can set per actor storage in the module settings if you want each different actor to have it's own companion list.
 Advanced
If you want a particular actor to have it's own summon list you can use
the included macro to switch the actor from global storage to local (on the actor).
Simply place a linked actor on the scene, select it and run the macro.
Using the other macro to switch it to global again will not wipe the saved companions so setting it to local at a later date will restore the previous list.
For more advanced users you can set the flag with the following command : `actor.setFlag(AECONSTS.MN,"isLocal",false)` (set true/false to enable disable local storage)
 Custom Macros
You can assign custom macros to specific actors.
The steps are as follows:
 Create a macro with this naming structure `AECompanionMacro(ActorName)`
where `ActorName` is replaced with the actor's name.
  - A macro for an actor named Bat would be `AECompanionMacro(Bat)`
  - This will get fired any time a creature with that name is summoned
 Add code for the custom data, in the context of the macro `args[0]` contains the
following data:
 Data | Description | Notes |
 summon | The actor that's getting summoned |  |
 spellLevel | The level of the spell that triggered the summoning |  |
 duplicates | How many creatures are getting summoned |  |
 assignedActor | The actor assigned to the player doing the summoning | This will be the selected token actor if no assigned actor is found, this is always the case for GMs.  The macro must return the custom data. |
You can use the `getSummonInfo` API call (`CompanionManager.api.getSummonInfo`), passing in `args` and the base spell level, to get the following information automatically calculated for you:
 Data      | Description                                                     |
 level     | How many levels above the base spell level the spell as cast at |
 maxHP     | The actor's max HP                                              |
 dc        | The actor's spellcasting DC                                     |
 attack.ms | The melee spell attack bonus of the actor                       |
 attack.rs | The ranged spell attack bonus of the actor                      |
An example using Flaming Sphere with auto scaling:
js showLineNumbers
 Macro name: AECompanionMacro(Flaming Sphere)
const summon = CompanionManager.api.dnd5e.getSummonInfo(args, 2);
const flamingSphere = {
  sphere: [`${summon.level + 2}d6`, "fire"],
return {
  embedded: {
    Item: {
      "Flaming Sphere": {
        "data.description.value": `Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the sphere, or has the sphere rammed into it, must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC ${summon.dc}). The creature takes ${flamingSphere.sphere[0]} ${flamingSphere.sphere[1]} damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.`,
        "data.save.dc": summon.dc,
        "data.damage.parts": [flamingSphere.sphere],
      },
    },
  },
Every time an
actor named `Arcane Hand` is summoned, the custom data will be applied
 Supported Spells
To use the included automations you will need
to import both the Actor and the corresponding Macro from Automated
Evocation compendiums! The ever expanding list of spells currently
includes: All the SRD spells for dnd5e, if something is missing let me
know
 Custom and non-SRD spells
Image
  src='/images/Automated-Evocations/Aecustombindingmenu.png'
  alt='Configure Bindings Setting'
  className={styles.wikiImage}
To add your custom spell bindings use the Custom Bindings setting in the module settings.
 Open the `Configure Custom Bindings` menu 
 Click `Add Binding`
 Rename the binding with the name of the spell or feature you want to bind by clicking on the name. This is `Case Sensitive`
 Click the `Edit` button, a new window will open where you can configure this Binding
 Click the `Add Binding` button to add a new creature
 Edit the creature name to match the creature. This is `Case Sensitive`
 Edit the number to summon and the animation.
 Close the windows.
 Custom Animations
To add your own animations, you can merge your own
configs to the default one. Once you built the object you wanna merge,
simply save it to the hidden game setting
game.settings.set(AECONSTS.MN, "customanimations", yourData)`
Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Setting this hidden setting will override any previous value, so you
want to keep a file with all you custom setting and add to it every time
you want to apply it!
Callout>
Example: Adding your animation to the list:
js
const customanims = {
  energy2: {
    fn: "light2",
    time: 650,
    name: "Energy 2",
    group: "My Group", //optional
  },
game.settings.set(AECONSTS.MN, "customanimations", customanims);
 `fn`: name of the macro to fire
 `time`: how long to wait from the animation start before spwaning the token
 `name`: the displayed name
Example macro:
js
const template = args[0]const tokenData = args[1];
const tokenScale = (Math.abs(tokenData.texture.scaleX) + Math.abs(tokenData.texture.scaleY)) / 2;
await new Sequence()
    .effect()
    .file("modules/automated-evocations/assets/animations/energy\spark\CIRCLE\_01.webm")
    .belowTokens()
    .randomRotation()
    .atLocation(template, { randomOffset: true })
    .repeats(6,50, 25, 75, 60,20)
    .scale(Math.max(tokenData.width,tokenData.height)  tokenScale  0.15)
    .wait(500)
    .effect()
    .file("modules/automated-evocations/assets/animations/energy\pulse\yellow\_CIRCLE.webm")
    .belowTokens().atLocation(template)
    .scale(Math.max(tokenData.width,tokenData.height)  tokenScale  0.35)
    .play()
 Manually invoking the companion manger on spell cast
If you are
on non DND5E systems you can trigger the companion manager for specific
spells with a macro or the module Item Macro
js
new SimpleCompanionManager(
  [
    {
      id: "actorid", //id of the actor to summon, if you have the name use game.actors.getName(name).id
      animation: "animationid", //id of the animation - set to undefined for
      defaultnumber: 1, //number of creatures to spawn
    },
    {
      id: "actorid",
      animation: "animationid",
      number: 1,
    },
  ],
  spellLevel,
  actor
render(true);
spell level is the spell level of the spell that summons the companions (will be passed to the companion macro), actor is the actor that summons the companions

 Betters Roofs
ModuleInfo/>
Betters Roofs is a module for enhancing Foundry's overhead tile
functionality.
 Required Modules
 
 Features
 Reveal in Fog
When this option is enabled, the full tile will be revealed in the Fog
of War and display as "explored". Keep in mind that this settings works
of the vision radius of the token, if the token has no vision radius the
roof will not show. This features uses the image itself for detection,
so if your roof tile is completely enclosed in walls, the roof will not
be revealed. In the same way, if a roof is illuminated by a light it
will not be revealed.
Note: If you are using `Levels`, the `Top` of the tile needs to be set
to `Infinity` for the tile to count as a roof (an this feature to
work)
Image
  src='/images/Better-Roofs/OverheadTileSettingsBetterRoofs.png'
  alt='Overhead Tile Settings'
  
  
  className={styles.wikiImageSmall}
 Occlusion ID
This id is used to create "groups" of tiles, imagine it as a tag, it can
be any text you wish, such as "house-1-canopy"
 Occlusion Links
With Occlusion Link you can link the occlusion state of tiles.
A tile marked as Occlusion Link Source will set all the tiles with
matching Occlusion Link ID to its occluded state
For example, let's say you have trees that are overlapping with the roof
of a building, when you are inside the building and the roof is occluded
not visible) you don't want the trees to be visible inside the house.
Simply assign the same occlusion link id to the trees and the roof, then
set the roof as occlusion link source. When the roof is occluded, the
trees outside will disappear as well. Keep in mind that if you were to
enable Occlusion link source on the trees as well, going under one tree
will make all trees and the roof occluded.

 Carousel Combat Tracker
ModuleInfo/>
A carousel style combat tracker. Spiritual successor of Combat Carousel. Inspired by games such as Solasta and Baldurs Gate 3 it will give you and your players a videogame style combat experience.
 How to use
Image src="/images/combat-tracker-dock/carouselinfo.png" alt="Carousel Interface" className={styles.wikiImage}/>
The Carousel will open automatically whenever there is an active combat and will close when the combat ends.
Whenever the Carousel opens, the Scene Navigation will be automatically collapsed.
 Combat Controls
Hovering the Carousel will reveal the combat controls on the left and right side of the carousel. These are the controls you are used to in the regular combat tracker.
 Portraits
Hovering over the portraits will reveal the Portrait Controls, these include Toggle Defeated, Toggle Hidden, and Ping.
 Tooltips
Hovering over the portraits will also reveal a tooltip, if you have ownership (or are GM) you will see the full informations, otherwise only the Name, Initiative and Status Effects will be visible.
You can customize what Attributes are shown in the modules settings.
 Configuration & Customization
Image src="/images/combat-tracker-dock/carouselconfig.png" alt="Carousel Configuration" className={styles.wikiImage}/>
To open the configuration menu, click on the  button on the top right of the Carousel.
 Attributes
Here you can configure the two Tracked Resource, which will be shown on the portrait as text and bars.
 Customization
To access the advanced configuration, where you can customize the look and feel of the Carousel, click on the `Configure Carousel` button.
 System Support
While Carousel Combat Tracker is compatible with all system, it contains some special handling to show system-specific additional information.
The module will work regardless of the presence of explicit support, but some systems might display some oddities (For example without the SWADE system support, cards would not be shown as the initiative value)
If you wish to contribute to the system support, please send a PR for the System Configuration script! 
 FAQ
 Can I reposition the Carousel? No, the Carousel is always docked to the top side of the screen.
 I don't see the Tracked Resource Bar on the Portrait, why? The Tracked Resource Bar is only visible if you have set a Tracked Resource. Open the Combat Tracker Settings with the Cog icon and set a Tracked Resource.
 Can you add explicit support for X system? I'm not knowledgeable enough about all the systems to add explicit support for them, but if you send me a PR for the  file I'll gladly add it to the module. If you are not familiar with coding, your best bet is to ask community developers in your system channel!
 Known Issues
 The Carousel animation is very complex, as such, clicking on the next or previous button multiple times in quick succession can cause the animation to glitch out. Even though you'll see this visual glitch, the carousel will still work as intended and display the correct order.
 The V10 Version Tooltips don't work on Firefox or in the Foundry Client, use a Chromium browser.

 Argon Combat HUD
ModuleInfo/>
Image
  src='/images/Argon/Argonmainhud.png'
  alt='Argon Main HUD'
  
  
  className={styles.wikiImageSmall}
A Solasta
inspired HUD to make your games easier for your players and for teaching
new players without a hitch. It is only D&D 5e compatible.
 Basics
 Opening the HUD
Image
  src='/images/Argon/Hudspells.png'
  alt='The Spells HUD'
  
  
  className={styles.wikiImageSmall}
To open the HUD, click the
crossed swords icon in the token controls (top left buttons) or click
the same button in the token hud (right click on a token). A macro is
also included to toggle the hud.
 Spells
Expanding the spells panel will show you how many maximum and remaining
spell slots you have for each level. You can customize visibility of
prepared spells in the module settings.
Image
  src='/images/Argon/Argonactiontracking.png'
  alt='Action Tracking'
  
  
  className={styles.wikiImageSmall}
 Action Tracking
Argon provides a basic action tracking, there is no option to undo or
manually change the tracking, opening and closing the hud will reset the
action tracking. The action tracking will not prevent you from using
actions.
 Save/Skills/Tools
Image
  src='/images/Argon/Weapon_Sets.png'
  alt='A screenshot of the weapon sets menu'
  
  
  className={styles.wikiImageSmall}
This panel provides easy access to the respective checks and tools.
 Weapon Sets
Above the portrait are 3 sets of 2 boxes. The left boxes represents the
action and the right boxes represents bonus actions.
NPCs will have their sets created automatically. For PCs simply drag &
drop items from the character sheet to the weapon sets boxes.
Image
  src='/images/Argon/Saveskilltoolshud.png'
  alt='Saves/Skills/Tools Panel'
  
  
  className={styles.wikiImageSmall}
To remove an item drag it from the weapon sets box to the character
portrait (a trash can will appear). Weapon sets are not limited to
weapons, for example a caster could use it for frequently used cantrips.
By default switching sets will also equip or unequip the items.
 Movement Tracker
A basic movement tracker will track remaining squares of movement during
Image
  src='/images/Argon/Argontooltips.png'
  alt='Tooltips'
  
  
  className={styles.wikiImageSmall}
a round. The tracker will turn yellow when getting to dash and turn red
when it's exceeded (the third red bar could be used for the rogue double
dash as well)
 Tooltips
Tooltips provide useful information on the items, you can change which
tooltips are shown (including no tooltips) in the module settings, these
are client side settings.
 Target Picker
Callout type='warning' emoji='⚠️'>
  In order for players to target using the Left mouse button, you'll need to install the  module.
As an alternative, players can still use the T key to target.
Callout>
When this feature is enabled, whenever you click on an action in the HUD, you will be prompted with a target selection mode.
While in target selection:
 - The number of Selected/Required targets will follow your cursor
 - Left click (or T) to target a token
 - Right click to cancel target selection
 - Click `+` or `-` to increase/decrease the number of maximum targets manually
 Common Issues
Argon was made
for Chrome. If you experience weird UI issues, consider switching
browsers.
 Portraits not showing
If your image path has parenthesis "(" or ")" the image will fail to
load, this might be true for other special characters as well
 FAQs
 Can you add compatibility for X system?
No, Argon is hardcoded for dnd5e. If you want you can make a fork for a
specific system. You have to include the licence section and credit the
original authors (theripper93, Mouse0270) and include links to our
patreon page\website (if provided).
 Why is xyz type of item not in the HUD?
We had to make a choice on what to include, anything that's not on those
categories is not included (a 1 minute cast time spell for example, or a
consumable that is used as bonus action). Those items will not be added.
You can use Sets for any item.
 Why the items in the HUD are not updating correctly?
Only a select number of elements are dynamically updated. To manually
update the HUD simply close and reopen the Argon HUD.

 Enable Path Patrol
If enabled the token will follow the given path/paths. This option is
mutually exclusive to "Enable Random patrol".
 Use Multiple paths
If enabled the token will use multiple paths.
 Patrol Path
The name(s) of the path(s) the token will follow if patrolling paths.
 Path Node
The node of the path at which the token is currently on. This setting
can be changed to start tokens mid-way through paths.

  src='/images/Patrol/PatrolTokenConfig.png'
  alt='Patrol Token Config'
  
  
  className={styles.wikiImage}
 Alerting
When a player is spotted a question mark will appear on top of the enemy
token which will then try to chase the intruder.
After a set time has passed the token will be spotted. You can configure
sad time in the module settings.
If the alert time is set to 0 the character will be immediately spotted.
 Custom Patrols
You can have a token patrol a specific area by drawing a Polygon or
Rectangle (other shapes are not supported) and in its's text property
call it "Patrol" (upper case P). Any token in that area will patrol only
inside that area
You can also draw a Polygon or Rectangle, and in it's text property
include the word "Path" (upper case P) to select the drawing as a path
for patrolling tokens. You may add to the word, but it must include the
word "Path" somewhere. (eg. GuardPathA, GuardPathB). A token set to
patrol a path will reset back to the beginning of the path once it has
finished unless "Use Multiple Paths" is checked.
The speed for tokens patrolling paths will be determined by the "Patrol
speed for paths(ms)" module setting. This setting defines how long it
will take every token patrolling a path to arrive at the next node.
Thus, the actual animation speed will depend on the distance from the
current node to the next one. This means that tokens can "speed up" mid
path by drawing longer nodes or "slow down" by drawing shorter nodes.
Please ensure that only one of the patrol types is checked in the token
config.
 Using Multiple Paths
If the "Use Multiple Paths" checkbox is enabled in the token config, You
can draw multiple paths with the same name. The token will randomly
select one of the other paths with the same name when it has finished
patrolling its current path. It will give preference to paths that are
not currently being patrolled by any tokens.
It is often a good idea to hit the "Remap paths and Reset Nodes" button
after making any changes to any paths or patrolling tokens. This will
reset the token's path node to either 0, or to a random path and node
within the group if the "Reset to Random Node" is checked.
 Auto Rotate
Patrol is compatible with the Auto Rotate module. Combine them for auto
rotating patrols\!
 Issues
 Patrol is not working
If patrol is not working, check this steps before opening an issue:
 If a token is selected it will stop patrolling
 If you create a combat encounter the patrol will stop
 If you have the game paused, the patrol will stop
 If you haven't toggled the patrol button the patrol will not start
 If path patrol mode tokens will not spot players
 Integration
You can use Patrol's hooks to enable additional features. Use the hooks:
 `"prePatrolSpotted", (spotter, spotted)`
 `"patrolSpotted", (spotter, spotted)`
 `"prePatrolAlerted", (spotter, spotted)`
 `"patrolAlerted", (spotter, spotted)`
Example:
js
Hooks.on('prePatrolSpotted', (spotter, spotted) => {
  // Only actually spotted if the Spotter has a higher passive perception than the target's DC
  return spotter.passivePerception >= spotted.passiveDC;
js
Hooks.on('patrolSpotted', (spotter, spotted) => {
  // Start a new combat if needed, then add the spotter to the spotted with a surprise round

 V10+ Data Path update
When updating to V10+ you will probably need
to update your datapaths, this basically means removing any `data` from
the path, for example for dnd5e it would be `attributes.hp.value` as you
can see the `data.` is no longer in the path.
 Additional Information
Blood and guts exists, why make a new one?
Blood and guts was a massive project and while it was amazing, with a lot of code comes a lot of issues and it's extremely difficult to mantain and fix.
This implementation is simpler and more streamlined, and while it has less features, it will be much easier to mantain or adopt if it ever gets abandoned.
Callout type='info' emoji='ℹ️'>
  No feature requests will be implemented
Callout>
The point of this module is to keep it streamlined to avoid making it impossible to maintain. Unless it is something that all the users of this module would greatly benefit from.
Please refrain from asking. Thank you for understanding :)

 Tile Scroll
ModuleInfo/>
Scroll, rotate, and repeat tiles over time.
 How to use
Callout type='warning' emoji='⚠️'>
  Tile scroll will not work with tiles with an `Occlusion Mode` of `Radial` or
  `Vision`
Callout>
Image
  src='/images/Tile-Scroll/Tsconfiguration.png'
  alt='Tile Configuration'
  
  
  className={styles.wikiImage}
You can set all the tile animation parameters in the Animation tab of the tile configuration.
 Enable Scroll and Rotation
Enabling these will enable the animations. You can have both enabled at
the same time or only one of them.
 Direction
The direction in degrees of the scrolling.
 Speed
Speed of the animation, if you want to reverse the animation (for
example rotate in the opposite direction) you can use a negative speed
 Texture Repeat
How many times the texture is tiled. If you wish, you could use Tile
Scroll just for tiling by setting the speed to 0
If you are using rotation, and you don't want the tile to repeat outside
it's bounds, you can set Texture Repeat to 0, keep in mind that due to
how Tile Scroll works you'll need the edge of the texture to be
transparent for the Texture Repeat = 0 to work correctly. This is
unfortunately a limitation of the implementation.
 Rotation Pivot
This pivot represents a percentage of the tile. A pivot of 0.5, 0.5 will
rotate the tile along the Center, while a pivot of 0,0 will rotate along
the top left corner, 1,1 along the bottom right and so on.
 Offset
The offset is also percentage based and works with the same logic as the
pivot.

Easily sort how tiles are stacked, hide tiles for easier management of
stacked tiles and highlight tiles on hover.
 How to use
Image
  src='/images/Tile-Sort/Tsoverview.png'
  alt='The Tile Sort Interface'
  
  
  className={styles.wikiImage}
 Sorting Tiles
To sort the tiles, simply drag and drop in the list
 Hiding Tiles
Hovering over the image of the tile in the tile sort window an eye icon
will appear, clicking it will hide the tile until you close the tile
sort window or click the button again. This will allow you to work and
move tiles that are overlapping the hidden tile more easily.
 Opening the tile configuration
Image
  src='/images/Tile-Sort/Tsbtn.png'
  alt='The Button to open Tile Sort'
  
  
  className={styles.wikiImageSmall}
Double clicking a tile in the Tile Sort interface will open it's config,
this will allow you to open a tile configuration without moving other
tiles that could overlap it.
 Highlihting
Hovering over a tile in Tile Sort will create a colored highlight of the
tile that will make spotting overlapping tiles easier

Easily manage the Z-Index of tokens.
 Auto Sorting
Image
  src='/images/Token-Z/Tzindex.png'
  alt='Z-Index Field'
  
  
  className={styles.wikiImage}
Token-Z is opinionated and will auto sort based on some parameters:
 Elevation: With a maximum priority
 Size: with a weight of -1 (this means a token that is 2x2 will have
  a -4 z-index to it)
 Selected: with a weight of 1 (a selected token will have a +1 z-index
  applied)
 Defeated: with a weight of -1000
 Manual Sorting
Simply input a z-index value in the new field in the token config.
 Pushing Back
If you want to push a token back, you can press the `Z` key (rebindable). The pushing is temporary and refreshing the page or changing scene will restore the automatic sorting.

VTT Desktop Client
ModuleInfo/>
A simple and lightweight, chromium based, desktop client for your virtual tabletop games.
 Usage
Simply download the zip file from the Patron post, extract it, and run the executable (vtt-desktop-client.exe). Forge Login is currently not supported (only public games)
For non-windows systems, Follow the multiplatform release link and download your system's version installer.
 Performance
The classic question: "Is it better than the browser?". The answer is: "It depends". The client is based on chromium, but since there is no stuf around it or running in the background it will generally use a bit less resources. If you are using a powerful computer, you will probably not notice any difference. If you are using a weaker computer, you will probably notice a difference. How big is the difference? It depends.
Theoretically the VTT Desktop Client will not perform significantly better than a clean Edge install with only one tab open and no extensions and with all the hardware acceleration\gpus setup correctly.
So, what i can say for certain is. If you are using chrome with a lot of extensions (or other browsers for that matter) and you have weak hardware, you will probably notice some improvement.
 Customization
Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
If you used the Setup to install the client, you can find the `config.json` file in the `C:\Users\%yourusername%\AppData\Local\fvttplayerclient\app-%version%` folder.
Callout>
You can pre-configure and customize the client by editing the `config.json` file. From where the executable is located, you can find the `config.json` file by navigating to the `resources/app` folder. You can edit the file with any text editor.
 Config Options
Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
Be mindful of trailing commas, they are not allowed in JSON. If you want, you can use an editor such as VSCode or an online tool such as JSON Formatter to validate your JSON.
Callout>
This is an example configuration file:
json
    "games": [
        {
            "name": "This is the name of my game",
            "url": "https://url-to-my-game.com"
        }
    ],
    "background": "https://url-to-my-img.com/img.jpg",
    "backgroundColor": "#000000",
    "textColor": "white",
    "accentColor": "hsl(0, 100%, 50%)"
 Games
The games array is where you can add your games. Each game object has a name and url property. The name is what will be displayed on the button, and the url is where the client will navigate to when the button is clicked. These preconfigured games cannot be deleted from the client.
 Background
The background property is where you can set a background image for the client. This can be a url to an image, i suggest using imgur to host custom images.
 Background Color, Text Color, Accent Color
These properties are where you can set the background color, text color, and accent color of the client. These can be any valid css color value.

 Connections with invalid certificates (SSL)
Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
While this flag could be directly added to the application, therefore avoiding this procedure, i don't plan on doing so. This is because it could be a security risk, and i don't want to be responsible for that.
Callout>
While it's suggested to setup a valid SSL certificate for your VTT, if you are using a self-signed certificate or your certificate is invalid, you can follow this procedure:
1. Locate the `vtt-desktop-client.exe` file.
2. Create a shortcut to the executable.
3. Right click on the shortcut and select `Properties`.
4. In the `Target` field, add the following at the end of the path: ` --ignore-certificate-errors`.
5. Click `Apply` and `OK`.
If you wish to embed the flag directly in the application, you can follow this procedure:
1. Locate the `vtt-desktop-client.exe` file.
2. Navigate to the `resources/app` folder.
3. Open the `main.js` file with a text editor.
4. Locate the `app.commandLine.appendSwitch("forcehighperformance_gpu");` line at the beginning of the file.
5. Add this new line below it `app.commandLine.appendSwitch("ignore-certificate-errors");`.
6. Save the file.
If you distribute this modified version of the application to your players they won't have to follow the shortcut procedure.
 Pop Outs
If you are using the PopOut! module, you will have to do a small modification for it to work, the developer has been contacted for a fix. In the meantime:
Open the `popout.js` (lines 460-463) file in the PopOut! module folder, and remove or comment the following lines:
Before
js
 Check if popout in Electron window
if (navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase().indexOf(" electron/") !== -1) {
    ui.notifications.warn(game.i18n.localize("POPOUT.electronWarning")); // eslint-disable-line no-undef
    return;
After
js
 Check if popout in Electron window
 if (navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase().indexOf(" electron/") !== -1) {
   ui.notifications.warn(game.i18n.localize("POPOUT.electronWarning")); // eslint-disable-line no-undef
   return;
 }
 Packaging
If you created a custom configuration file and want to share it with your players, you can simply zip the whole `vtt-desktop-client-win32-x64` folder and send it to them. They can then extract the zip file and run the executable.

 Wall Height
ModuleInfo/>
Wall Height is a module that allows setting vertical heights to walls.
It allows tokens to look over or under walls and to move over or under
them according to relative heights as well.
 Basics
Image
  src='/images/Wall-Height/TokenHeightAdjustment.gif'
  alt='Token Height Adjustment Menu'
  
  
  className={styles.wikiImage}
 Required Modules
 
 Tokens
Tokens are able to see over walls which are below them in elevation. Likewise, tokens
cannot see through walls that are higher than them in.
To change a token's elevation, right-click the token. You will see an
input box in the top left of the token HUD. This is the token's
elevation. Modify it by selecting the box and entering the desired
elevation for the token.
 Token Height
Callout type='warning' emoji='⚠️'>
  If you are using the  module, remember that if the
  height of a token pushes it's head through a ceiling, you will see the floor
  above you!
Callout>
Image
  src='/images/Wall-Height/TokenHeightSetting.png'
  alt='Token height input in token settings'
  
  
  className={styles.wikiImage}
The height of a token, which is different than the elevation of it. It represents
how tall a token is and is used in sight calculation.
To modify the height of a specific token, go to token settings and
change its value. All non-0 values will override the default settings
for the token.
Automatic Token Height` and `Default Token Height` in module settings
determine the default for all tokens.
If you wish to double check what is the computed value for a specifi token when it's height is set to 0 (thus triggering the automatic calculation), you can check it in the text displayed below the Token Height in the Token Configuration
 Walls
Image
  src='/images/Wall-Height/WallConfigMenu.png'
  alt='The wall configuration menu'
  
  
  className={styles.wikiImage}
Walls can be assigned a top elevation and a bottom elevation, representing the highest
and lowest point of the wall respectively.
Their values can be edited in the wall configuration menu. To access the
wall configuration menu, double click the wall you wish to modify.
You will now see the Wall Height section at the bottom of the wall
configuration menu. There are two inputs available: `Wall Height (Top)`
and `Wall Height (Bottom)`. The default values are `Infinity` and
Infinity` respectively.
 Settings
Image
  src='/images/Wall-Height/SceneConfigWall_Height.png'
  alt='The scene setting for Wall Height'
  
  
  className={styles.wikiImage}
Enable Wall Height for Scene` in scene settings is enabled by default. If you wish
to disable it, it can be done in scene settings. However, this will mean Wall Height's
features cannot be used in the scene.
 Enable Tooltip
Image
  src='/images/Wall-Height/WallHeightTooltip.png'
  alt='The wall height tooltip'
  
  
  className={styles.wikiImage}
The tooltip will display when a wall is hovered, showing its lowest and highest elevation.
 Display Height on Walls
While enabled, displays the elevation values of a wall on the wall itself.
Image
  src='/images/Wall-Height/WallHeightDisplay_Value.png'
  alt='Display Height on Walls'
  width={115}
  height={115}
  className={styles.wikiImage}
 Vaulting
Allows for tokens to move over walls at a lower elevation than their
height.
 Example
Imagine a token at 0 elevation, with a token height of 5, and a 0, 3
Wall
 Vaulting Enabled: The movement of the token is not blocked
  because with a height of 5 the token can see over the wall.
 Vaulting Disabled: The movement of the token is blocked because
  its elevation (or its feet if you will) is at 0 and the wall blocks
  movement at 0 elevation.
 Automatic Token Height
Calculates the token's height by via token size and scale.
 Example Heights
A 1x1 token on a 5ft grid would be 5ft tall, a 2x2 token would be 10ft,
and a 1x1 token with a 0.75 scale would be 3.75 ft.
 Default Token Height
The default height of all tokens. Default height is 6. This value is
only used if `Automatic Token Height` is disabled.
 Enable Constrained by Elevation Globally
Area of effect sources will be constrained by walls corresponding the
elevation the source instead of the elevation of the controlled token
while enabled.
 Migrate Wall-Height Data On Startup
Migrates wall-height data from the old wall-height data (pre-4.0)
structure to the new one (4.0+) for users migrating from older versions.
This is only necessary once but you can enable this settings and refresh
the page if you need to run it again.
 Developers
 Elevation Helpers
To avoid data duplication, Wall Height uses a data path belonging to the
 module to store it's elevation. If
 is not enabled you can use these helpers to
read and set the elevation of a sound or light document.
js
WallHeight.setSourceElevationTop(document, value);
WallHeight.getSourceElevationTop(document);
WallHeight.setSourceElevationBottom(document, value);
WallHeight.getSourceElevationBottom(document);
Or, if you want to set/get both at the same time:
js
WallHeight.setSourceElevationBounds(document, bottom, top);
WallHeight.getSourceElevationBounds(document);
 Other
 Migration to 4.0
Data structures were rewritten in version 4.0 of Wall Height. Scenes and
other entities from pre-4.0 Wall Height require migration.
During the first launch of Wall Height v4.0+, the module will auto
migrate the data on all your scenes and compendiums (this includes token
attacher data).
If you need to migrate the data again, you can always do so by enabling
the setting in the module settings and refreshing. Macros are also
included to run migrations if needed.
 Content Creator Maps and Prefabs
To manually migrate content with the old data structure:
1. Enable the modules that you wish to migrate (e.g. Baileywiki Maps
   Towns )
2. Unlock all the actor compendiums containing Token Attacher
   Prefabs
3. In the Wall Height Macro compendium `Wall Height Macros` run the
   `Wall Height - Migrate Everything` macro
4. In the Token Attacher Macro compendium `Example Macros` run `(TA)
Migrate Actors for Wall Height` and `(TA) Migrate Compendiums for
Wall Height` macros
5. It is now migrated to the new data structure
 Modules
Wall Height is very likely to incompatible with modules which modify
token vision.

Depth Blur (Levels - Depth Blur in releases) is a submodule of
 Applies a blur effect to layers in and
tokens depending on the current elevation. The farther you are from a
level, the more blurrier it will be.

Automatic Cover Calculator _(Levels - Automatic Cover Calculator in
releases)_ is a submodule for . It calculates
a precise cover percentage for tokens and can display their cover value
above tokens.
Options include defeated enemies as cover but at a reduced height and
more. Preconfigured for dnd5e but works with all systems. Also adds the
ability to duck\!

 Drop some NPCs and Players onto the map
 Enter Combat
 Target a Creature
 Why is the cover calculation not working?
Image
  src='/images/Levels-Auto-Cover/MidiQol_Settings.png'
  alt='Location of settings'
  
  
  className={styles.wikiImage}
 Make sure the combat is started and that you are targeting with the
  current turn creature.
 As a GM, Targeting from a Player's token will not calculate cover to
  avoid database update concurrency issues
 Make sure there is a wall or floor that provides cover
 You can test this easly by placing a wall that completely obstructs
  vision, then, disable vision on the token (so that it can see tokens
  beyond the wall) and try targeting (you should get 3\\4 cover)
 Ignoring Cover
If you have an actor for which you wish to ignore the cover active
effect application, you can do so with an active effect on the actor or
on the specific feature, the necessary flag to ignore cover is
flags.levelsautocover.noae` set the Mode to `Override` and Value to `1`

 Custom Configuration and other settings
The Automatic Cover Calculator can be heavly customized, head to the
module settings to see all the customization options.
All settings are described in details in the Settings hints.
 Cover Definition
This can be defined in the settings, defaults to `25,Three Quarters Cover|50,Half Cover` but can be changed to anything you want.
Remember that the number refers to the visible percentage of the target, for example a target that is 25% visible will have Three Quarters Cover.
 Ducking
Ducking will allow tokens to duck, changing their sight elevation and
therefore being able to hide behind tables and the like.
To toggle ducking, simply click the button in the token HUD!
 Midi-qol Integration
If you are using Midi-qol it's suggested that you let it take over cover
handling, Automatic Cover Calculator will just act as a library module
handling the math. To do so, simply enable these 2 settings in the
Midi-qol configuration

 Levels - Volumetric Templates
ModuleInfo/>
Volumetric Templates (Levels - Volumetric Templates in releases)
is a submodule of . It allows for compute
Foundry templates in 3D with autotargeting. Automatic mode to
dynamically switch between 2D and 3D depending
on the information provided. Works with all systems and is  compatible.
 How to use
Image
  src='/images/Levels-Volumetric/Vtmanual.png'
  alt='Template Configuration Button'
  
  
  className={styles.wikiImage}
Volumetric templates will work automatically with normal templates
placement.
The module will automatically figure out if a template needs 3D
Calculations or not if `Dynamic auto swap` is enabled in the module
settings.
By default, circles will be spheres, and cones will be calculated as
cones. Other shapes (boxes, cylinders, hight for rays) will need the
special field to work in 3D.
 Manually configuring a template
Image
  src='/images/Levels-Volumetric/Vtconfigscreen.png'
  alt='Configure Template Prompt'
  
  
  className={styles.wikiImage}
If you need to set the Special field, or
manually set the elevation at which the template is placed you can do so
with the configure template button.
 Elevation
If you don't set an elevation, the elevation of your currently selected
token will be used
 Special
Image
  src='/images/Levels-Volumetric/Vtspecialtemp.png'
  alt='3D on template'
  
  
  className={styles.wikiImage}
This field will tell Volumetric Templates the 3rd dimension of the
template. Spheres and cones don't need it so that's why you don't need
to set it for those.
 Circle: If a Special is set, the circle will be calculated as a
  cylinder with the Special being it's height
 Cone: Special will be ignored for cones
 Rectangle: The special field will determine the height (or
  depth) of the Rectangle
 Ray: The special field will determine the height (or depth) of
  the Ray
 When a special field is set,
it will be shown in the template dimensions.
 Configuration
In the module settings you can find many options to customize Volumetric
Templates, the most important field is the `Volume Percentage`, this
will determine how much a token needs to overlap with a template to
count as a target. Tokens are simplified to Cubes for intersections.

 API
The Token browser allows for matching minis by name with some APIs:
First make sure the list of assets is loaded, to do so you can use the following code:
js
await game.canvas3D.CONFIG.UI.TokenBrowser.preloadData()
Then you can use the following code to get the assets matching a name:
js
game.canvas3D.CONFIG.UI.TokenBrowser.findByName("goblin")
If you haven't preloaded the data, you can run the async version of the function which will automatically load the data if it's not already loaded:
js
await game.canvas3D.CONFIG.UI.TokenBrowser.findByName("goblin", {async: true})
The function will return an array of matches, the path of the asset will be in the `output` property of the object.
If you wish to retrive just a single result as a string, you can use the following code:
js
game.canvas3D.CONFIG.UI.TokenBrowser.findByName("goblin", {returnFirst: true})
By default the API will execute a fuzzy search, if you wish to disable this behavior you can use the following code:
js
game.canvas3D.CONFIG.UI.TokenBrowser.findByName("goblin", {fuzzy: false})

 Generating Thumbnails for 3D Files
If you have a folder of your own 3D Models, you can generate Thumbnails
that will be used by Filepicker+ to display. To do so, simply run this
in the console or as a script macro replacing the path accordingly.
js
game.threeportrait.ThreePortraitPreview.generateThumbnails("your/path/")
Example:
js
game.threeportrait.ThreePortraitPreview.generateThumbnails("assets/3dModels")
By default this command will skip generating a thumbnail if it already
exists, if you wish to generate anyways (for example to replace old
thumbnails) you can set the second argument to false
js
game.threeportrait.ThreePortraitPreview.generateThumbnails("your/path/",
false)
Thumbnail generation requires Chrome or the Desktop App, it won't
work in other browsers\!

Townscaper
 is
a steam game that can be used to algorithmically create towns with
colored blocks of houses on an irregular grid. Towns created using
Townscaper can be exported and retextured using Blender for use in .
This guide outlines the steps required to do so.
 Creating & exporting a town in Townscaper
Creating a town in Townscaper simply involves selecting a color from the
color palette and clicking on the canvas to place paths and houses. Once
a town has been created, expand the settings by clicking on the cogwheel
in the top-right corner of the screen. Click the "Export .OBJ" button
only available on PC) to export the town mesh and texture models to a
folder of your choice.
 Importing & retexturing the .obj model in blender
Download & open  in
Blender. Once loaded, delete everything in the scene, by clicking on all
the objects in the outliner panel, on the right, and pressing the
delete` key on your keyboard.
Next, import the .obj model you created with Townscaper by navigating to
File \> Import \> Wavefront(.obj).
When importing your .obj model, expand the Geometry options on the
right-hand pane and check the "Split by Group" checkbox.
Once your model has been imported, locate and delete the object named
Water from the outliner panel on the right. There are better water
textures & shaders available for use within 3D Canvas and hence this
mesh has not been retextured.
In the original Townscaper game the doors and windows are inset, in
order to get a similar effect do the following:
 Flip the normals of all the windows \[Select Windows (in the
    outliner panel) -\> Go into edit mode (tab) -\> Open the normals
    menu (Alt + N) -\> Click "Flip"\]
 Add a boolean modifier to the House object \[Select House (in the
    outliner panel) -\> Click modifier properties (the wrench
    icon along the right panel) -\> Add Modifier -\> Boolean\], set to
    difference and within the Object field select Windows.
 Press `Ctrl` + `A` to apply the modifier to House
 Delete the windows object.
 You may either want to set the house to shade flat (right-click -\>
    Shade Flat) or add an edge split modifier, your choice.
After correcting the House mesh to include doors and windows, click
through each remaining object (Birds, Fencing, House, Plants, Props,
Sand) in your scene, with the outliner, navigate to the material
properties panel, and replace the material named Town with the one named
TownCombined, as shown in the image.
Once all the objects have been set to the same material, click on the UV
editing tab along the top of your blender window to change your active
workspace. Press `Tab` on your keyboard to go into object mode. Hover
your cursor over the 3D viewport on the right and press `A` on your
keyboard to select all objects. Then press `Tab` again to toggle back
into edit mode, having selected all remaining meshes in your scene.
Next, hover your cursor on the UV editor panel on the left. Press `A` to
select the entire UV unwrap. Press `S` followed by `X` and then type
0.0625, to scale your selection in the X-axis by a factor of 0.0625.
After scaling the UV unwrap it needs to be translated to the correct
position for retexturing. This is the most difficult step as the amount
of translation needed varies from model to model. The steps to do this
involve hovering your cursor on the UV editor panel, pressing `A` to
select the entire UV unwrap, press `G` followed by `X` and then the
necessary translation amount for your model. The translation amount is
always negative and it varies from model to model, try translating until
the door triangles are all correctly positioned on the leftmost corner
of the texture. This is shown in more detail below:
Your Townscape model is now retextured using Principled BSDF materials.
To use this model in 3D Canvas, go to File \> Export \> glTF 2.0

 Fog of War & Vision
 Quick Start
To setup fog of war in 3D we will look at 4 settings, they will be referenced throughout this section. You can find them here:
 - Token Vision in the scene settings (lighting tab)
 - Fog Exploration in the scene settings (lighting tab)
 - Use 3D Geometry for sight calculations in the scene settings (3D tab)
 - Enable Fog of War in the scene settings (3D tab)
 Default settings
By default you will have the following settings when creating a new scene:
 1. Token Vision Enabled
 2. Fog Exploration Enabled
 3. Use 3D Geometry for sight calculations Disabled
 4. Enable Fog of War Disabled
With these settings the 3D Map will be completely visible, tiles will not block vision and the fog of war will not be rendered.
Token visibility will still be blocked by walls.
 Full fog of war
To have the full fog of war experience in 3D Canvas, you need to enable the following settings:
 1. Token Vision Enabled
 2. Fog Exploration Enabled
 3. Use 3D Geometry for sight calculations Enabled
 4. Enable Fog of War Enabled
With these settings the 3D Map will be completely hidden, tiles will block vision and the fog of war will be rendered.
Note that this is the most demanding setting and will have a negative impact on performance on scenes with large wall\tiles count.
 Token Vision only
This is a middle ground where the whole map will be visible but tokens will be blocked by walls and tiles.
 1. Token Vision Enabled
 2. Fog Exploration Disabled
 3. Use 3D Geometry for sight calculations Enabled
 4. Enable Fog of War Disabled
 No Vision
Some maps, especially battlemaps, don't really require vision and can be a better experience for the players without it.
If your players have very weak hardware, consider disabling vision in maps that don't benefit from it.
 1. Token Vision Disabled
 2. Fog Exploration Disabled
 3. Use 3D Geometry for sight calculations Disabled
 4. Enable Fog of War Disabled
 Use 3D Geometry for sight calculations
Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Enabling this setting will disable vision completely while in 2D mode since there is no 3D geometry in 2D mode.
Callout>
This is a very important setting, enabling it will, as the name suggest, use 3D Models to calculate token visibility and sight polygons.
Whith this setting disabled, only walls will be used to calculate visibility and you will be able to see through tiles.
 Shared Context
Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  It is not recommended to disable Shared Context.
Callout>
Shared Context is a global setting. If enabled, it allows for fog of war
to be rendered in real-time with better performance and better quality. The downside is that you will lose access to the Mini-Canvas
 Fog Exploration
If you have both Token Vision and Fog Exploration enabled in the
scene settings, 3D Canvas will mirror the 2D Canvas fog. This means that
fog bounds are solely determined by walls in the scene.
If you have Token Vision enabled but Fog Exploration disabled, the whole scene will be revealed but walls and geometry (if set in the scene settings) will prevent tokens from seeing each other if blocked by
obstacles.
 Fog Limitations
Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Fog is not 3D! Fog exploration is 2 dimensional.
Callout>
Exploring any space will explore the full vertical space of that location. There are no current plans for 'true' 3D fog exploration because of performance costs.
 Manual Fog of War
If you wish to have some semblance of a 3D Fog, you can use Box Measure
templates to create Fog of War boxes. It will mimic the use a piece of
paper to cover the map table experience—but in 3D.
Simply place a Box Measured Template, open it's configuration, and
enable `Is Fog of War Box`
Players will see this box as solid black. GMs will see it semi
transparent. Moving the camera inside the box will obscure the view. The GM can move or remove these boxes during the exploration.

 3D Canvas Particle System
 Creating an Effect
First create a `Script Macro`, then to start creating your effect simply call
js
new Particle3D(type);
type` is the type of particle effect, at the moment the options are:
 Effect     | Type         | Type (short) |
 ---------- | ------------ | ------------ |
 Projectile | "projectile" | "p"          |
 Sprite     | "sprite"     | "s"          |
 Ray        | "ray"        | "r"          |
 Explosion  | "explosion"  | "e"          |
If no type is provided the default is `"p"`
Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Note that "Sprite" also accepts 3D Models as particles!
Callout>
Now you can start chaining properties, similar to how Sequencer works. Every time you call a `.method()` on a `Particle3D` it will always return the `Particle3D` object, allowing for chaining. The only exception is the `.start()` method that will return the ID if the `Particle3D`
First we must provide an origin and a destination.
js
new Particle3D(type).from(origin).to(destination);
 `.from()` & `.to()`
These two methods are required on every effects, each one can take a single `Token` or an array of `Tokens` or a single `Position` or an array of them. Non `Token` placeables are also supported.
A `Position` is defined by `{ x:0, y:0, z:0 }` where `z` is in elevation units.
Explosion` effects are the exception as they do not require a `.from()`
Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  You can omit both `.from()` and `.to()` when creating an effect inside
  `.onEnd()`. In that case the `.to()` will be set as the target of that
  particular effect.
Callout>
Let's set up our origin as the selected token and the destination as our targets
js
new Particle3D(type).from(token).to(Array.from(game.user.targets));
At this point we can `.start()` our Particle3D to play the effect and the default settings will be used (it will look like a firebolt)
js /start/
new Particle3D(type).from(token).to(Array.from(game.user.targets)).start();
 `.start()`
The `.start()` method takes no arguments and will simply start the effect. After using this method you should not interact with the `Particle3D` anymore. Use the returned ID instead if you wish to stop the effect, see the  section below.
If you wish you can call `.start(false)` to only play the effect locally.
 Stopping an Effect
When creating an effect, the effect will return it's id. You can use this Id later to stop the effect. You can also execute `Particle3D.stop("all")` to stop all effects.
If you used the `.name()` property on effect creation you can also `.stop(name)` to stop all effects with that name.
 Try it yourself
These are several examples showcasing the Particle3D system that are a good starting point for understanding the system and creating your own custom effects.
Create new `Script Macros` in your game with the code blocks below to try them out in 3DCanvas and see the different effects. You can adjust the variables to see how those influence the effects. These macros are also all available to import directly in the `3D Canvas Particle Effects` macro compendium!
Simply select a token, target some tokens and run the macros, you will see them in action!
 Examples
 Frostbolt

Callout type="error" emoji="️🚫">
  You must not call `.start()` on the `Particle3D` inside the `.onEnd()`. The
  Particle3D inside the `.onEnd()` can have an `.onEnd()` as well, allowing for
  infinite chaining.

 Wall of fire (stop)
Notice how the new `Particle3D()` is assigned to a variable, then a set timeout
stops the effect after 1000 milliseconds. With the same logic you could store
the ID and stop an effect on concentration end.
js /Particle3D/
const effectId = new Particle3D("r")
  .from(token)
  .to(Array.from(game.user.targets))
  .sprite("modules/levels-3d-preview/assets/particles/flame_01.png")

  .rate(100, 1)
  .gravity(-5)
  .start();
setTimeout(() => {
  Particle3D.stop(effectId);
 1000);
 Wall of fire (stop with name)
Once you assign a name you can stop the effect from a completely different macro.
js /Particle3D.stop/
const effectId = new Particle3D("r")
  .from(token)
  .to(Array.from(game.user.targets))
  .sprite("modules/levels-3d-preview/assets/particles/flame_01.png")

  .name("Wall of Fire")
  .scale(1.5)
  .duration(Infinity)
  .rate(100, 1)
  .gravity(-5)
  .start();
In a different macro later on - we stop the effect
Particle3D.stop("Wall of Fire");
 Spirit Bolt (Explosion Chaining)

 Particles Properties & Behaviours
We can now add properties to the effect in any order to alter it's appearance
 `.alpha(start,end)`
This property requires start and end to be numbers between 0 and 1 - sets the starting and ending opacity of particles
 `.arc(integer)`
This property takes an integer and indicates how many times the projectile will curve before reaching it's destination. Default is 0
 `.color(start,end)`
This will determine the starting and ending color of the effect, only start can be provided. start and end can also be arrays of colors (eg `.color([color1,color2],[color3,color4])`.
If an array of colors is provided for start/end the system will pick one of those colors randomly as the starting/ending color - it will not create a multicolor gradient.
The colors can be in any format, HEX is recommended but you can use any CSS compatible color - even using `"red"` will work.
 `.delay(milliseconds)`
If `.repeat()` is set, this will be the delay between each repeat.
 `.duration(milliseconds)`
Duration in milliseconds of the effect, valid only for "ray". Default is 300 milliseconds
 `.emitterSize(number)`
Radius of the area of emission in grid squares (so 1 would be 1 grid square), the larger the number the more spread out the particles will be in their starting point. Default is 0
 `.force(number)`
If using an explosion, set the force of the explosion, default is 15.
This will determine the force with which the particles are propelled from the origin. Higher numbers will result in faster particles.
 `.gravity(number)`
Gravity affecting the particles - 1 is Earth gravity.
Higher numbers means particles will travel down faster depending on their mass.
Negative gravity is also possible if you want particles to go up instead.
 `.life(min, max)`
Range in milliseconds of the lifetime of a particle, bigger numbers will equal to longer trails. default (100,500). A single value is also accepted.
 `.mass(number)`
The Mass of the particle, this will affect how much gravity pulls down the particle. Default is 100.
 `.miss()`
If added to the effect, it will miss the target. You can also call `.miss(Boolean)` if you prefer.
 `.name(string)`
You can give a name to an effect, if you do so, you can call the `.stop()` method using this name and all effects with this name will be stopped.
 `.onEnd(particle3D)`
You can pass another particle3D or an array of particle3d to the `.onEnd` method, if you do so, these effects will be played when the main effect ends, you can nest this how many times you want but DO NOT call the `.start()` method on Particle3D inside the `.onEnd()` method. Does not trigger when the effect is terminated by `.stop()`
 `.playAnimation(animationData)`
Play a 3D Animation, the animation data is formatted as follows
js
  // The from property specifies which animation should be played
  // on the origin of the particle effect (usually the caster or attacker)
  from: {
    // The id of the animation to play
    id: "twirl",
    options: {
      //If the animation should be played on start of the effect
      start: true,
      // If the animation should be played when the effect ends (like a projectile reaching it's target)
      end: false,
    },
  },
  // The from property specifies which animation should be played
  // on the origin of the particle effect
  // (usually the caster or attacker)
  to: {
    id: "shake",
    options: {
      //If the animation should be played on start of the effect
      start: true,
      // If the animation should be played when the effect ends (like a projectile reaching it's target)
      end: false,
    },
  },
 `.push(dx,dy,dz)`
The pushing force affecting the particles, this is a method generally used internally for fixed emitters - it will create an effect on the particles as if a force was pushing them in a specific direction. Default is (0,0,0).
 `.rate(particles,milliseconds)`
The Rate of the emitter, where particles is the amount of particles in the system and milliseconds is how often the system creates a particle. Default (12, 16)
 `.repeat(integer)`
The number of times to repeat the effect
 `.rotation(x,y,z)`
Rotation in degrees of the particle, only used if using a 3D Model as particle
 `.up(x,y,z)`
A unit vector (eg .up(1,0,1) ) representing the direction of the "tip" of the model (eg, an arrow or a dagger), only used if using a 3D Model as particle
 `.rotateTowards()`
Instead of a projectile, do a swinging motion, only used if using a 3D Model as particle
 `.scale(min,max)`
The starting and ending size in in grid squares of a single particle. Default is (0.8,0)
 `.speed(number)`
The speed of the projectile. Default is 10.
 `.sprite(pathToFile)`
The path to the image to be used as particle. Default is `modules/levels-3d-preview/assets/particles/emberssmall.png` you can find many particles in that same folder.
 `.startAfter(milliseconds)`
Delay the start of the effect by the specified milliseconds

 Shaders
Shaders are a way to create great visual effects, these tend to be easier on performance than using animated 3D Models or Animated Textures.
Still, keep in mind that shaders are not free, they will cost you performance, so use them wisely. It's always possible to disable shader effects per client.
 Configuring Shaders
You can configure shaders in the `Configure Shaders` window. This window can be opened by clicking the `Configure Shaders` button in the 3D Tab of Tiles, Templates and Tokens.
The window will be the same for all of these.
Once you have opened the window, you will see an interface with a Tab for each shader. Each tab will have a list of options that you can configure for that shader and a description that will explain what the effect does.
To enable a shader, simply head to the corresponding tab and check the `Enabled` checkbox.
 Quick Shaders
On tokens, it's possible to quickly enable shaders, for example if you are in the middle of a fight and you want to set a token on fire.
To do so, simply right click on the token to bring up the Token HUD, locate the Magic Wand button on the right and click it, A panel will open where you can quickly toggle shaders on that token.
 DnD 5e integration
If you are using Dnd 5e, shaders will be automatically applied to Measured Templates when casting a spell depending on the type of damage of the spell. You can disable this in the module settings.
 Performance
Some effects are almost free, while others can be very expensive depending on the usage.
The more expensive effects are marked with a warning sign in their description. If you are experiencing performance issues, try disabling these effects.
Effects that are not marked with a warning can generally be used freely even on low-end devices.
 Freezing & Stuttering
When enabling a shader for the first time, after the scene has been loaded, you may experience some freezing or stuttering. This is normal and will go away after a few seconds.
This is due to the fact that the shader needs to be compiled and the browser needs to cache the compiled shader. Unfortunately this is a WebGL limitation, there is no way to avoid this as it's not possible to fully precompile the shaders.

Drawings
Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    It's not possible to use or display drawings insde 3D Canvas, due to tecnical limitations, usability and performance concerns this feature is not planned.    
Callout>
If your drawings have some special triggers enabled by other modules, those will still work even if the drawing is not visible.

 Lights
To create a light, simply go to the light layer and drag to create a light, all the standard foundry interactions are the same.
 Animations
Only a select amount of light animations are supported in 3D.
The following animations are supported:
 Pulse
 Chroma
 Flickering Light
 Particle Emitters
Lights can also be used as particle emitters, to do this, simply enable the "Enable Particle Effect" option in the light settings under the 3D Tab.
From here you can tweak the settings to your liking.
 Limitations
Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
3D Lights will not be blocked by walls\tiles or cast shadows because of WebGL limitations. It's also incredibly expensive on performance.
Callout>
You can enable Shadow Casting/Wall Blocking in the 3D Tab for specific lights, but it's highly suggested to not use more than 2-3 lights per scene while enabled. Enabling this option on a large number of lights
will crash the scene.
If the scene crashes because of the settings, and you are not able to access the 3D or 2D Scene, disable 3D Canvas (or launch your world in safe mode) and delete the shadow casting lights.
 Freezing & Stuttering
When creating a light, you will notice some freezing and\or stuttering. This is because every time a light is added to the scene, all shaders need to be recompiled.
Unfortunately this is a limitation of WebGL, and there is nothing I can do about it.
In the event that you need to create a lot of lights, i suggest creating them in 2D mode, then switch to 3D to position them as moving lights will not cause freezing or stuttering.

Notes
Notes in 3D Work exactly the same as in 2D.
 3D Model
The only extra feature available in 3D for Notes is the possibility to set a 3D Model as their icon instead of the default Cube.
To do so, simply open the Note configuration and select the 3D Model you want to use. Below the 3D model field you can also find a rotation slider to adjust the orientation of your 3D Icon.

 Measured Templates
Placing a template will work the same way as in 2D, but because we have a third dimension we have an extra control to set the height of some shapes.
 Creating a Measured Template
To create a Measured Template simply drag while in the Template
Controls with a shape selected.
Creating Cones or Circles (spheres) works the same way as in 2D as the third dimension is implied.
When creating a box or a ray template, you'll be able to use the scroll wheel to set the height of the template.
 Making a Cylinder
Since this is not obvious, to create a cylinder, head over to the Token
Controls  and click the `Set Elevation for next placed Template` button . In the Special field, set the height of the cylinder (in grid units). Then place a circle template.
 3D Template settings
3D Templates only have one extra setting compared to 2D ones (outside of the shader configuration) , you can head in the 3D Tab in the template configuration to set a template to be a Fog of War box
 Fog of War box
Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Keep in mind that only Rectangle Templates can be used as Fog of War boxes.
Callout>
Fog of War boxes are a special type of template that will hide the area they cover from the players. This is useful for hiding areas that are not yet explored by the players.
Because Fog of War in 3D is still two dimensional and can be expensive on performance, the Fog of War box is a light and effective solution for multifloor or large dungeons.
As a GM, you will see the Fog of War boxes as semi-transparent boxes, while the players will see them as fully opaque.

 Tiles
Tiles are your bread and butter when it comes to building a map in 3D, they serve as both decoration and as a way to block sight and movement.
For this reason it's generally discouraged to use Walls when building 3D Maps.
While you can use 2D Tiles in 3D, it's highly suggested that you use fully 3D Tiles for the best experience. If you still wish to use 2D Tiles, check the bottom section for more information.
This page will cover many concepts, you can use this quick links to jump to the most common sections.

 Placing 3D Tiles
To place a 3D Tile, open the filepicker while in 3D Mode and in the Tiles Layer. The file picker will now show 3D Files instead of 2D Images.
Drag and drop a file from the filepicker to the scene to create a 3D Tile, 3D Canvas will give your tile a placeholder 2D Image as well, required for Levels to adjust visibility when needed and to make it clear that you have 3D Tiles on the map, you can change this placeholder image but it's not suggested to leave it Blank.
If you wish to see 3D Models previews in the file picker, you will need the Filepicker+ and 3D Portraits Modules.
After placing a 3D Tile, you can manipulate it by selecting it and using the Gizmo controls. You can read more about them in the `Tile Editor Tab` in the 
This is the most basic usage of 3D Tiles, but exploring the options in the 3D Tab will give you a lot of power to create whatever you want.
 3D Tiles Options
We will now go into a deep dive of the 3D Tab in the Tile Configuration and how to master the available tools to make a quick work of enhancing your 3D Maps.
Some of the feature are quite advanced, remember that you don't need to learn everything at once, you can always come back to this page to learn more.
Before we begin, click the `Show Advanced Settings` button at the bottom of the 3D Tab to expand the configuration to all it's glory.
We will now explore all the options, some options will be grouped and discussed together.
 3D Model
This is the most important option, it's the 3D Model that will be used for the Tile.
It operates the same way as the core Foundry VTT image fields (such as the Token Image field). You can either input a URL or use the Filepicker button to select a file from your storage.
 Dynamic Mesh
Image
  src="/images/3D-Canvas/dynamesh.png"
  alt="Dynamic Mesh Shapes"
  className={styles.wikiImage}
The Dynamic Mesh option is a very powerful tool, it allows you to generate 3D Models on the fly, depending on how you configure it.
The `Dynamic Mesh Resolution` option allows you to specify how complex the generated geometry will be, the higher the number, the more complex the geometry will be, but also the more performance it will take to render.
 Dynamic Mesh Types
If the option is set to anything other than `None (use 3d model)` the 3D Model field will be ignored.
 Basic shapes
These options will create basic shapes, these include `Box`, `Sphere`, `Dome`, `Cylinder`, `Tube`, `Cone`.
They all operate in the same way, as in they will create a basic shape that you can then customize with other settings.
This is the most basic usage of the Dynamic Mesh option, an example usage of this would be to create a Box, set it to a blue color (or apply a texture) and enable the Ocean Shader. In a matter of seconds you created a lake, river or ocean for your scene.
 Billboard
The Billboard and Billboard (cross) options will a model which is a combination of multiple (2 or 3) planes, this is especially usefull to create vegetation that is very cheap to render.
This option is often used in combination with the repeat mode (discussed below) to create a forest or a field of grass.
 Text
The Text option will create a 3D Model that is a text, this is usefull to create signs or labels for your scene.
After selecting the Text option, you can input your text in the 3D Model field (since the text is the 3D Model).
 Map Generator
Image
  src="/images/3D-Canvas/mapgenresult.png"
  alt="A map generated using the Map Generator"
  className={styles.wikiImage}
This is by far the most versatile option. After selecting the Map Generator option, a `Cog` button will appear to the right of the Dynamic Mesh dropdown, after clicking it you will be presented with a new window, this window allows you to configure the Map Generator to your liking.
Since this can be intimidating at first, you can watch a video tutorial on how to use it  as it offers a more visual explanation.
 Material Customization
Image
  src="/images/3D-Canvas/mapgeninterface.png"
  alt="Map Generator Interface"
  className={styles.wikiImage}
This section will include all the settings that allow you to customize the material of the 3D Model and will cover the options from `Texture` all the way down to `Sides`
 Texture
The `Texture` option allows you to apply a texture to the 3D Model, this is the most basic way to customize the material of the 3D Model.
You can ether select a single texture or a full material using the `Material Browser` provided by the  module.
The `Texture Repeat` slider allows you to set how many times the texture will repeat on the 3D Model.
The `Flip Y` option will flip the texture on the Y axis, this is usefull if your texture is rendered upside down but in general you can ingore this setting.
The `Tint Color` option allows you to set a color that will be applied to the texture, this is usefull to get more milage out of a single texture.
 Heightmap/Heatmap
The `Heightmap` option allows you to apply a heightmap to the 3D Model, this will displace the geometry depending on the black\white intensity of the image.
Some heighmaps are included in the  module, but you can also use any image you want.
You can set the intensity or invert the heightmap using the `Heightmap Intensity` and `Invert Heightmap` options.
If your tile is in `Repeat` mode, the hightmap will be used as a Heatmap instead. A heatmap describes the density of distribution when using the `Repeat` mode, the darker the pixel, the more likely it is to spawn a 3D Model.
 Other Material Options
The rest of the options will let you customize the appearance of the material further.
 The `Roughness` option will set the roughness of the material, this is usefull to make the material look more or less shiny.
 The `Reflectivity` option will set the metalness of the material, this is usefull to make the material look more or less reflective.
 The `Opacity` option will set the opacity of the material, this is usefull to make the material look more or less transparent.
 The `Shading` option will set the shading of the material, this is usefull to make the material look more or less smooth.
 The `Sides` option will set the sides of the material, generally this should be correct by default, but if you are using (for example) a dynamesh cylinder you will not see the 3D Model when looking at it from the insde. In this situation you might want to change this option to "Double side"
 Positioning
The `Positioning` section will allow you to customize the position of the 3D Model. You shouln't need to change any of these settings by changing them manually but they are exposed for advanced users.
The `Auto Center` and `Auto Ground` option will automatically center and ground the 3D Model, this is usefull if you are using a 3D Model that is not centered or not on the ground by default. The `Auto Ground` option is enabled by default.
The `Tilt X` and `Tilt Y` options will tilt the 3D Model on the X and Y axis.
The `Depth` option is the 3D Counterpart of the Width and Height options in the regular tile settings, it will set the depth of the 3D Model.
 Animation
The `Animation` section will allow you to enable and select animations for the 3D Model.
The `Enable Animation` option will enable or disable the animation of the 3D Model.
The `Animation Index` option will allow you to select the animation that will be played by the 3D Model if more than one is present.
The `Animation Speed` option will allow you to set the speed of the animation.
The `Paused` option will allow you to pause the animation (this is also accessible in the Tile HUD).
 Random Seed
The `Random Seed` option is used by the Repeat mode and the Terrain generation, you can change this value to whatever you want to re-randomize.
 Vision
The `Vision` section will allow you to customize how the 3D Model will interact with sight and collisions.
 The `Block Movement` option will allow you to set if the 3D Model will block movement, disabling this option will let tokens pass through it. An obvious usecase would be disabling this on Grass.
 The `Block Sight` option will allow you to set if the 3D Model will block sight. It's recommended to disable this option on any tile that does not requires it as it will improve performance. Things like grass, trees, or even floors don't need to block sight!
 The `Camera Collider` option will allow you to set if the 3D Model will prevent the camera from going through it, this is only relevant if Game Camera is enabled.
 The `is Door` option will allow you to set if the 3D Model will be treated as a door, this will allow you to open and close it with the regular Foundry interactions (Left click to open\close, right click to Lock\Unlock). A secret door can only be opened by a GM.
 The `Door State` option will allow you to set the initial state of the door, this is only relevant if the `is Door` option is enabled.
 Tiling
Image
  src="/images/3D-Canvas/terrainrepeat.png"
  alt="Terrain made with the Terrain Option and Grass\Trees made with the Repeat Option"
  className={styles.wikiImage}
The `Tiling` section will allow you make multiple copies of the same 3D Model in a single tile, this is usefull for things like grass or trees.
Using the `Repeat` mode is a lot more efficient than copy pasting the same 3D Tile multiple times.
Once you set the `Fill Type` to `Repeat` you will be able to set the randomization options. The randomization options are self explanatory and will not be covered here.
 Shaders
The `Shaders` section will allow you to customize special effects on the 3D Model. The shader configuration is covered in the  page as it's shared between multiple entities.
 Terrain
The `Terrain` section will allow you to generate a terrain using the 3D Model as a base. It's suggested to use a Dynamic Mesh basic shape for this.
After selecting a `Noise Type` you will be able to set all the options for the noise. There are many noise options and the best way to understand them is to play with them.
 Merging 3D Tiles
Image
  src="/images/3D-Canvas/merge.png"
  alt="Merge/Un-Merge Button Location"
  className={styles.wikiImage}
It's very common to have multiple 3D Tiles that use the same model and texture that you need to manually place one by one instead of relying on the randomized `Repeat` mode.
As discussed above, having multiple 3D Tiles is not efficient and will slow down your game, luckly 3D Canvas will let you merge multiple 3D Tiles into a single one.
To merge 3D Tiles, select multiple 3D Tiles and click the `Merge` button in the 3D Tile HUD. The button can be accessed by right clicking one of the selected tiles to bring up the HUD.
3D Canvas will automatically figure out which of the selected tiles can be merged and will group them accordingly. The previously multi-copy tiles will be replaced by single merged tiles that are considerably more efficient.
To un-merge a 3D Tile, select it and click the `Unmerge` button in the Tile HUD.
Callout type="info" emoji="">
Un-merging a tile will restore the original tiles to their previous position, rotation and scale before merging.
Callout>
 Auto Merging
Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Any bulk/automated operation can inherently be dangerous, please make sure to make a duplicate of your scene before using this feature.
Callout>
3D Canvas offers a macro that will automatically optimize your scene by merging all the tiles that can be merged.
This operation will skip any currently selected tile and all door tiles even if they could be merged.
You can find this macro in the `3D Canvas Macros` compendium and it's named `Auto Merge All Tiles`.
 Advanced
 Making a Multilevel 3D Map
Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
For this to work, first enable the "Mirror Levels Tile Visibility" in the 3D Tab in your Scene Configuration.
Callout>
If you wish to make a multilevel 3D Map, where the 3D Objects above you are not visible, Open the Levels UI and define the amount of levels you wish, then, select a level.
A Magenta colored Plane will appear, to indicate where you are building, start draging and dropping 3D Object onto that plane to build on that level, repeat for the other levels.
If you now explore the map with a token selected, you will see that Objects above you will be hidden.
 Tagging 3D Models with Collision and Door data (Blender)
Image
  src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1346839/176191860-6514a287-04b9-4cd4-b65b-74390b85f956.png"
  alt="Blender Tagging Location"
  className={styles.wikiImage}
You can add metadata to your 3D Models in a way that 3D Canvas will be able to read it and automatically make parts of your Mesh Doors or set collision\sight blocking on submeshes separetly
1. Select the mesh you wish to tag
2. Head to the 'Object Properties' tab and scroll to the bottom, Expand 'Custom Properties' and add them as needed (list of supported properties below)
3. When you are done tagging all your meshes export the file as GLTF/GLB and make sure to include the custom properties in the export
Tabs items={['Supported Properties', 'Collision and Sight', 'Doors']}>
  
The property names are case sensitive!
 Property Name    | Type    | Value           |
 ---------------- | ------- | --------------- |
 collision        | Integer | 0/1             |
 sight            | Integer | 0/1             |
 isDoor           | Integer | 0/1/2           |
 doorId           | String  | Any Unique Name |
 ds               | Integer | 0/1/2           |
 doorStyle        | Integer | 0/1             |
 doorAnimateAngle | Integer | Degrees         |
  
  
    
    Setting collision and sight will tell 3D Canvas whether to block these 'senses', for example you would set on solid meshes both 'collision' and 'sight' to 1, while on a window 'collision' to 1 and 'sight' to 0. If you had an ethereal wall for example, you would set both to 0 or 'collision' to 0 and 'sight' to 1.
    Note: You don't need to set collision and sight on all of your meshes. If the data is missing, 3D Canvas will use what is set globally on the tile (by default 1\1)
  
  
    In order for 3D Canvas to recognize and process a door correctly, any door you want to tag must have 'isDoor' set to 1 and a 'doorId' of your choice (eg "TavernDoorA". Keep in mind that every doorId must be different (no duplicate Ids)
    The 'ds' property tells 3D Canvas the Door State: 0 - Open, 1 - Closed, 2 - Closed and Locked 
    The 'isDoor' property tells 3D Canvas which type of door the door is: 0 - Not a Door, 1 - Regular Door, 2 - Secret Door
    The 'doorStyle' property tells 3D Canvas which style of door the door is: 0 - Transparent, 1 - Animated
  
Tabs>
 2D Tiles
Tiles are placed at the bottom elevation set through the Levels module. While background tiles are rendered as well it's highly suggested that you instead use a single background image or you will have popping and flickering issues. The module  has an option to merge all your background tiles and background image into a single image.

Walls
Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    Since 3D Canvas mostly uses tiles for collision and sight blocking, which offer more flexibility in a 3D environment, it's not possible to place\draw walls in 3D but the walls placed in 2D will be displayed.     
Callout>
While walls in 3D will work the same as in 2D (they will block sight and collision) it's suggested to use tiles instead as they offer more flexibility and options.
 Customization
It's possible to change some of the walls' properties, such as the color, the opacity, the thickness, and the texture.
To do so, open the Wall configuration (from the 2D View or the Canvas popout) and head to the 3D Tab.

Visual Novel Choices
ModuleInfo />
Create a visual novel style choice menu with a list of choices and a title. Make
democratic or non votes, customize colors and background image, and trigger scene
changes or macros when a choice is resolved.
 How to use
Image src="/images/Choices/choiceswindow.jpg" alt="Visual Novel Choices Prompt" className={styles.wikiImage}/>
To create a choices prompt you will need to use the `/choice` chat command.
You can provide additional parameters to both the choice and the option
with this syntax: `[param=value]`.
The first line of the chat message (the one with `/choice`)
is the question. Every new line will be one option.
 Example
txt //choice/ /[player=Jhon,Mary]/
choice [img=path/to/my/image.jpg][player=Jhon,Mary] What path will you chose?
scene=path1] The Woods
scene=rockymountains] The Mountains
 Parameters
You can use the following parameters (all in the format `[param=value]`)

 Config Presets
ModuleInfo/>
Save presets for lights, walls, drawings, and more\! Keeps relevant
module information and can apply presets to existing objects. The
ultimate map making tool.
 How to use
Image src="/images/Config-Presets/Cpopen.png" alt="Config Presets button"   className={styles.wikiImage}/>
 Opening the Config Presets window
To open the Config Presets window, simply click on it's icon in the
scene controls. The list of presets is filtered based on the layer you
are on, for example if you are on the Walls layer, only walls presets
will be shown.
 Creating a preset
To create a preset, first select an object (for example a wall) then click on the
 button in the config presets window header.
Image src="/images/Config-Presets/Cpwindow.png" alt="Config Presets Window"   className={styles.wikiImage}/>
Note that some placeables cannot be selected, for this reason you will
not be able to select (for example) lights, to do so, it's reccomended
to install the module [Select Tool
Everywhere](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/select-tool-everywhere)
 Editing a preset
After creating a preset, it will appear on the list, from here you can
edit the preset.
 Editing the name
By default, the name of a preset will be the Id of the object used to
create the preset, to change it, simply right click on the name and it
will become editable. After editing press Enter or Right Click to
confirm your changes.
 Duplicating
The first icon in the preset will let you duplicate that preset.
Image src="/images/Config-Presets/Cppresetedit.png" alt="Editing a Preset"   className={styles.wikiImage}/>
 Editing the data of the Preset
If you don't want to keep all the data from that preset (for example you might only want the flags from the wall, that contain height data from wall height) you can remove unnecessary data by clicking the edit button
located left of the delete button. By clicking the checked icon near to each data property you can remove it.
Note that by default config presets will exclude some properties from
the presets, such as position, radius and other. If you wish to keep all
properties and manually remove the ones you prefer, you can change this
behaviour in the module settings.
 Deleting
To remove a preset, simply click the trash can icon.
Image src="/images/Config-Presets/Cpselectpreset.png" alt="Selecting a Preset"   className={styles.wikiImage}/>
 Using a preset
To use a preset, first select it by clicking on it, it's background will
turn cyan. Once a preset is selected you have two options:
 Creating new Objects
With a preset selected, creating new objects will apply the properties
of the preset to that object. For example if your preset is a green
light with an animation, creating lights will make them green with that
animation but it will keep the size of the light as you placed it.
 Apply a preset to selected objects
With a preset selected and one or more objects selected, click the
button to the Right of the `+` button to apply the selected preset to
all selected objects.

 Opening the interface
To open the interface, click on the `Dynamic Soundscapes` button in the Sidebar Playlist tab. Alternatively, you can use the `Shift + S` shortcut.
 Creating a soundscape
Soundscapes are just regular playlists with some extra processing done by the module, you can simply create a playlist in the `Soundscape` folder or use the `New Soundscape` button in the interface.
 Adding sounds to a soundscape
To add sounds to a soundscape, click on the `Cog` button in the interface to open the Playlist configuration where you can Bulk Import, or click on the `+` button to add a single sound.

 Creating a Block
To create a block, simply click on an empty space in the interface. A new block will be created.
 Organizing
You can drag and drop blocks to organize them, you can also drag and drop sounds from one block to another.
 Configuring
To open the Block configuration, click on the `Cog` button in the block header. In this window you can configure the block name, type and color.
 Enabling Sounds
Ambient` and `Random` blocks require sounds to be enabled, in order to enable a sound, simply click on it. You can click again to disable it.
 Block types
There are 3 types of blocks:
 `Ambient` - Ambient blocks will play all enabled sounds inside them at the same time, they are useful for creating a background ambience.
 `Random` - Random blocks will play a random sound inside them chosen between the enabled sounds, they are useful for creating a more dynamic soundscape. You can set the frequency of the random sounds by setting the Time in the Block configuration.
 `Soundboard` - Soundboard blocks will play a single sound inside them, you cannot enable sounds in a soundboard block, instead, clicking a sound will play it.
 
 Playing a soundscape
When a Soundscape is in the `Stopped` state, all sounds from that soundscape will be stopped, and none can be played.
To play a soundscape click on the `Play` button to the right of the soundscape name.
When a soundscape is in the `Playing` state, the following will happen:
 All enabled sounds from `Ambient` blocks will be played at the same time and loop.
 Random sounds from `Random` blocks will be played at the frequency set in the block configuration.
 You will be able to play sounds from `Soundboard` blocks by clicking on them.
 API
 Setting a mood

 Epic Rolls 5e
ModuleInfo/>
A module to make group rolls more engaging with some flair and sound effects. Let your other players spectate the roll and see the results in real time!
 How to use
 Starting a new roll
Image src="/images/epic-rolls-5e/epicrollsbutton.png" alt="Epic Rolls button location" className={styles.wikiImageSmall}/>
To start a new Epic Roll, simply click on the epic roll button, located in the bottom half of the chat sidebar, above the chat input box.
You will be welcomed by a new window, where you can configure the roll you want to make.
 Configuring the roll
Image src="/images/epic-rolls-5e/epicrollsmain.png" alt="New roll window" className={styles.wikiImage}/>
The roll configuration window is divided into 3 sections:
 Player selection
In this section (on the left) you can select which players will participate in the roll. You can select all players, or select specific players by clicking on their name.
By default all players will be selected.
When an epic roll is started everyone will be able to spectate the roll, but only the selected players will be able to roll.
 Roll configuration
In this section (on the right) you can configure the roll itself. You can select what kind of check will be made, and what the DC will be.
Some extra options allow you to use the average roll instead of the actual roll.
Selecting an actor in the contested roll will roll the selected check from that actor and use it as the DC.
 Confirmation and roll
Image src="/images/epic-rolls-5e/epicrollspromt.png" alt="Epic Rolls interface" className={styles.wikiImage}/>
In this section (on the bottom) you can confirm the roll and start it. You can also cancel the roll and close the window.
The `Save as Macro` button will save the roll as a macro, so you can use it again later. Saving a roll as a macro will not save the selected players, so you will have to select them again when you use the macro.
 After the roll
Image src="/images/epic-rolls-5e/epicrollschat.png" alt="Post-roll Chat message" className={styles.wikiImage}/>
After the roll is finished, the roll window will close and the results will be posted in the chat.
Note that the results of the roll will be visible to all players, even if they were not selected to participate in the roll.
 Module Settings
The module settings will let you customize the sounds that are played when a roll is made, and when a roll is finished with different sounds for success and faillure.
By default the module uses the same sounds for success and faillure, but you can change them to whatever you want.
You can also delete chat messages generated by rolls made while in the epic rolls window. This option is suggested if you want a cleaner chat, since the roll results are displayed anyways at the end of the roll.

 [Simple
  Calendar](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/foundryvtt-simple-calendar)
  will allow the automatic reset of gathering spots depending on time
  passed, without it this feature will not work
 Premade Content
Want to start with some already made recipes and gathering points? 
Download the DnD5e [Potion Crafting &
Gathering](https://github.com/action-jay/potion-crafting-gathering)
module by  using [this
ManifestURL](https://github.com/action-jay/potion-crafting-gathering/releases/latest/download/module.json)\!
The module leverages both the 
and  modules, make sure you install
both\!
 Creating a Gathering spot
Image src="/images/Gatherer/Gatherersheetselect.png" alt="Selecting the Gatherer Sheet"   className={styles.wikiImage}/>
Gatherer works with `Roll Tables`, so
before you start create a roll table and drag and drop the items you
want for your Gathering Spot in it. To create a gathering spot, follow
this steps.
 Create a new `Journal` and create a new `Text Journal Page` in it
  (or add a Text Journal Page in an existing Journal)
 In the Page header, click the `Sheet button` and in `This Sheet`
Image src="/images/Gatherer/Gatherersheetfilled.png" alt="A Fully setup Gatherer Sheet"   className={styles.wikiImage}/>
  select `Gatherer Sheet`
 Select a Roll table from the drop down menu.
 Set the extra options you want, for this first tutorial we will use
  just the basics. We will give this gathering spot a 15 hours reset
  time and 10 draws (or pulls).
 The sheet should look like the one in the `A Fully setup Gatherer
Sheet` image
 `Note`: Due to a
   with the
  new V10 Journals, you might need to refresh the browser (F5) after
  your first setup of a Gatherer Sheet
 Once you saved and refreshed (if needed) your Journal Page should
  look like this when in view mode `Gatherer Sheet in View Mode` 
You can now gather from this sheet, remember that you need either a
token selected or a character assigned to gather\!
As a GM you can manually reset a spot with the Reset button\!
 Options
You can configure multiple options for the Gatherer Sheet
 Time
Specify the time in hours after which the timer and draws are reset. For
example, a time of 48 will reset the spot every 2 days. You can use
decimal values.
 Draws
The number of Pulls that can be made from this spot. Draws\\Pulls will
reset automatically with time or when pressing the Reset button.
 Quantity
The amount of items that will be gathered from this spot. This value is
the same for all items and cannot be customized per item. If you wish to
change item chances, you can always weight the table differently.
Quantity also evaluates roll expressions. For example `1d6+3` and `3`
will both work.
If you want to set per-item quantities, see the Better Rolltables
integration section.
 Require
Specify item requirements for this gathering, the parameters can be a
comma separated list of item names. The actor doing the gathering will
need to have ALL the Required items if multiple are specified. Example `Fishing Rod,Bait`
Image src="/images/Gatherer/Gathererminigame.png" alt="Gatherer Minigame"   className={styles.wikiImage}/>
 Minigame
The minigame tag will let the user pick the item to gather instead of
leaving it to chance\! When using this tag, instead of a table roll, the
user will be prompted with a window with items appearing in a random
sequence, when the user clicks the button the currently displayed item
will be awarded\! The time is in milliseconds, e.g. `800`.
Remember that the time you chose is then multiplied by the chance an
item has to be drawn from the table, so for example, if an item has 20%
chance of being drawn, it's display timer will be `800ms*0.2 = 160ms` so
make sure to pick an appropriate amount of time\!
And remember, the more you wait to pick the item the faster the minigame
will get\!
Note: Leaving this field empty will disable the minigame and use
standard table rolling.
 Expression
A Macro expression that will be evaluated before the gathering. If the
expression resolves to `false`, a Pull will be consumed but no items
will be gathered. Example `const res = await actor.rollSkill("inv");
return res.total > 15;` will roll an investigation check, if the result
is higher than 16 the pull will succeed.
If you wish to cancel a gathering alltogether, return `null` instead and
no pulls will be consumed.
 Checks (DND5E Only)
For the DnD5e system, a dropdown with ability/skill checks and tool
checks are available with corresponding DC\! The tool name is Case
Sensitive\! Failing the check will result in a consumed Pull but no
rewards.
 Better Rolltables Integration
If you have the Better Rolltables module installed, and you set `Better
Tables Type` to `Better Table` you will be able to set a `formula` for
each item. In this instance, Gatherer will use that formula instead of
the quantity specified in the Gatherer Sheet.

 Macro Wheel
ModuleInfo/>
Do you have too many macros? Macro Wheel is for you\! Press `M` or
Middle Mouse Button` to show an easy to use interface that can hold
infinite macros\!
 Getting Started
Image src="/images/Macro-Wheel/Macrowheel.png" alt="Macro Wheel in action"   className={styles.wikiImageSmall}/>
When you enable the module it will be already ready to go, simply press
M to display your macros in the Macro Wheel\! This said, a warning will
be shown prompting you to setup the macro wheel since the `MacroWheel`
folder is missing.
If you don't wish to do any specific configuration for Macro Wheel,
simply head into the module settings and enable `Use Root Folder`.
 Basic Configuration
Image src="/images/Macro-Wheel/Macrowheelsample.png" alt="A sample setup of folders and subfolders"   className={styles.wikiImage}/>
If `Use Root Folder` is
disabled, Macro Wheel will build the wheel using a folder named
MacroWheel`, let's set it up\!
 Open the `Macros Directory`
 Create a folder named exactly `MacroWheel`
 Every folder inside the `MacroWheel` folder will create a `Wheel`
    containing all the macros inside that folder, you can check the
    image to see how a sample setup looks like
 Customizing the Wheel
Every `Wheel` is a `macro folder`, so to customize it, simply edit the
folder. If you prefer, you can open the edit folder dialog by clicking
with the `right mouse button` on a wheel.
You will find 2 extra options
 Macro Wheel Image
This is the image used for the Wheel, change it to what you prefer\!
 Condition
Some premade conditions you can use to conditionally show a wheel. For
example selecting `In Combat` will only show the wheel if a combat is
active in the scene. Set to `Custom` to use the option below.
 Custom Condition
This is a condition that will be evaluated to determine if the wheel
should be shown, for example you could use the `canvas.activeLayer ===
canvas.tokens` condition to have the specific Wheel display only on the
token layer.
 Other Customizations
The module settings contains other customizations that are explained in
the setting itself, such as showing hotbars and customizing the macro
wheel size\!

 Timed Crafting
Callout type='warning' emoji='⚠️'>
  To avoid checking all actors on a regular basis which would cause network slowdowns and server strain, timed crafting will be processed whenever you open an actor sheet for that actor only.
Callout>
Recipes accept a time option, which is time in minutes. Keep in mind that this option will work based on world time so you will need some other module that handles time passing for it to work.
Such modules include  and/or .
If you wish to manually process timed crafting, you can use this macro.
javascript numberLines copy
ui.RecipeApp.processDelayedCrafting(Array.from(game.actors).filter(a => a.isOwner))
 Document Links
At the moment it's not possible to create links in journals\chat to recipes by drag and dropping them. The current Foundry API requires heavy core code modifications to achieve this, so it's on hold until the API is improved.
You can however manually create links to recipes by using the following syntax:
txt copy
mastercrafted[BookName.RecipeName]
Replace `BookName` and `RecipeName` with the name of the book and recipe you want to link to. If the recipe name is omitted, the link will point to the book instead.
 Advanced: Adding conditions to crafting
Adding conditions will allow you to add custom checks to crafting, for
example making a strength check in order to make an item (in addition to
other conditions). We will use the DND5E System in this example but it
will work with any system, refer to your system discord channel or macro
polo to know the correct macro commands for checks.
 Create a new script macro, for this example we will call it
  `StrengthCheck`
 Edit the recipe and type the exact macro name in the `Condition`
  field
 The macro will need to return an object `{ success: Boolean,
consume: Boolean }`
 `success` determines if the crafting is successful or not while
  `consume` determines if the ingredients are consumed in the event of
  a failed craft
 In the context of the macro, `actor` is the Actor doing the
  crafting.
 You can copy paste this sample macro to use as a template for your
  own
 Note: You can also copy paste the macro code directly in the
  `Condition` field, but make sure your lines correctly end with `;`
  as the code will be collapsed to a single line!
 Example: Ability Test
This macro for DnD5e shows how you can make a strength check and return the result. If the check is successful, the crafting will be successful and the ingredients will be consumed. If the check fails, the crafting will fail and the ingredients will still be consumed.
javascript numberLines copy
const roll = await actor.rollAbilityTest('str');
return {
  success: roll.total > 12,
  consume: true,
 Example: Tool Check
This macro for DnD5e shows how you can make a tool check and return the result. If the check is successful, the crafting will be successful and the ingredients will be consumed. If the check fails, the crafting will fail and the ingredients will still be consumed.
javascript numberLines copy
const toolName = "Alchemist's Supplies";
const DC = 12;
const tool = actor.items.getName(toolName);
const result = await tool.rollToolCheck();
return  {
    success: result.total >= DC,
    consume: true
 Example: Require and Consume a Spellslot
This macro for DnD5e shows how you can check if the actor has a spellslot and consume it if they do. If they don't have a spellslot, it will show an error message and prevent the crafting from happening.
javascript numberLines copy
const hasSpellslot = actor.system.spells.spell1.value > 0;
if(!hasSpellslot){
ui.notifications.error("No Spellslot")
    return {
        success: false,
        consume: false,
    };
await actor.update({'system.spells.spell1.value': actor.system.spells.spell1.value - 1});
return {
    success: true,
    consume: true,

 Media Optimizer
ModuleInfo/>
Automatically optimize images, audio and video on upload.
 How to use
Callout type='warning' emoji='⚠️'>
  This module will only work on Chromium based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc) and the Foundry VTT Desktop App.
Callout>
This module will automatically convert any images, audio and video you upload into foundry to WEBP, WEBM and OGG, it also has the ability to downscale the image.
You can configure compression and downscaling in the module settings. By default images will be compressed with a 0.75 ratio and kept at a maximum resolution of 8K, images above that resolution are not downscaled.
 Tile Combiner
Image
  src='/images/Media-Optimizer/combiner.png'
  alt='Tile Combiner Menu'
  className={styles.wikiImage}
The Tile Combiner is a powerful tool that allows you to combine multiple tiles and background image into a single image, this can considerably improve performance and load times for maps with a lot of tiles.
This feature will also render Token Magic FX and other filters to the final image.
Note that animated tiles are not supported.
 Mass Optimizer
Image
  src='/images/Media-Optimizer/massoptimize.png'
  alt='Mass Optimizer Menu'
  className={styles.wikiImage}
You can access the Mass Optimizer from the File Picker header buttons, this will allow you to optimize all media in the current folder at once.
Keep in mind that, as modules cannot delete files, the original files will not be deleted, you will have to delete them manually.
 Audio\Video Conversion
Callout type='info' emoji='ℹ️'>
   users don't need to do anything, the conversion will work out of the box.
Callout>
For the audio\video conversion to work, you need to create a shortcut to the chrome browser and add the ` --enable-features=SharedArrayBuffer` flag at the end of it.
The `target` of your shortcut should look something like this:
C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --enable-features=SharedArrayBuffer
 Audio\Video Conversion Time
Time for conversion can vary, but as a rule of thumb, it takes about 2 minutes to convert 1 hour of audio and 10 minutes to convert 1 minute of video.
If you wish, you can open the console (F12) and watch the conversion progress.
 Audio\Video Compression
The audio compression will depend on the original file, but it should be around 50% of the original size.
The video compression will depend on the original file, but it should be around 10% of the original size.
