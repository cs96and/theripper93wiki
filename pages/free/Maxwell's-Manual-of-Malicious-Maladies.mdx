# Maxwell's Manual of Malicious Maladies

**Maxwell's Manual of Malicious Maladies** (MMMM) contains 208 lingering
injuries based on the 13 different damage types. All with different
severities, durations, and consequences. Based on the titular [Maxwell's Manual of Malicious Maladies](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/l4ags0/maxwells_manual_of_malicious_maladies_a_34_page/).

The module contains compendiums of the injuries, effects, items, and
tables for rolling. Rolling for injuries can be automated through
settings, chat commands, and/or
[MidiQoL](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/midi-qol).

### Compendiums

Items and journals with the full content of the original homebrew are
available in compendiums. Injury tables are accessible and importable in
the tables compendium.

### Chat Commands

#### Rolling Injuries

- `/mmmm` will bring up a dialog with all the tables
- Specify a damage type to auto roll that table (e.g. `/mmmm radiant`)

#### Adding Injuries

The GM can click on the Red Virus <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faViruses} style={{color: 'red'}} /> button in the name of the injury (in
chat) to add it as an item to the target's character sheet.

Active effects will be added to items with the appropriate duration.
Note that these effects just serve as a reminder of the injury.

### Injury Automation

Injuries can be automated as well. Some will require
[MidiQoL](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/midi-qol).

MMMM can automatically prompt for injuries on:

- Critically failed saving throw
  ([**MidiQoL**](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/midi-qol) required)
- Critical hit
  ([**MidiQoL**](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/midi-qol) required)
- More than half hp of damage
- HP reaches 0

## Customization

This module will search tables by name, if the table is not found in
your sidebar the one in the compendium will be used.

You can import the tables and modify the injuries as you like, as long
as the name of the table remains the same.

Reading it (from the included journal entries or from the original PDF)
is highly suggested as it includes extra rules for healing injuries\!
