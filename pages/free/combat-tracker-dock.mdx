The Carousel will open automatically whenever there is an active combat and will close when the combat ends.
Whenever the Carousel opens, the Scene Navigation will be automatically collapsed.

### Combat Controls

Hovering the Carousel will reveal the combat controls on the left and right side of the carousel. These are the controls you are used to in the regular combat tracker.

### Portraits

Hovering over the portraits will reveal the Portrait Controls, these include Toggle Defeated, Toggle Hidden, and Ping.

### Tooltips

Hovering over the portraits will also reveal a tooltip, if you have ownership (or are GM) you will see the full informations, otherwise only the Name, Initiative and Status Effects will be visible.

You can customize what Attributes are shown in the modules settings.

## System Support

While Carousel Combat Tracker is compatible with most system, it contains some special handling to show system-specific additional information.

If you wish to contribute to the system support, please send a PR for the System Configuration script! [Github Repository](https://github.com/theripper93/combat-tracker-dock/blob/master/scripts/systems.js)

## Known Issues

- The Carousel animation is very complex, as such, clicking on the next or previous button multiple times in quick succession can cause the animation to glitch out. Even though you'll see this visual glitch, the carousel will still work as intended and display the correct order.
