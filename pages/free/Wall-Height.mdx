# Wall Height

Wall Height is a module that allows setting vertical heights to walls.
It allows tokens to look over or under walls and to move over or under
them according to relative heights as well.

## Basics

### Required Modules

- [libWrapper](https://github.com/ruipin/fvtt-lib-wrapper)

### Tokens

![Token_Height_Adjustment.gif](Token_Height_Adjustment.gif 'Token_Height_Adjustment.gif') Tokens are able to see over walls which
are below them in elevation. Likewise, tokens cannot see through walls
that are higher than them in.

To change a token's elevation, right-click the token. You will see an
input box in the top left of the token HUD. This is the token's
elevation. Modify it by selecting the box and entering the desired
elevation for the token.

#### Token Height

![Token height input in token settings](Token_Height_Setting.png 'Token height input in token settings') The height of a token, which is
different than the elevation of it. It represents how tall a token is
and is used in sight calculation.

To modify the height of a specific token, go to token settings and
change its value. All non-0 values will override the default settings
for the token.

`Automatic Token Height` and `Default Token Height` in module settings
determine the default for all tokens.

### Walls

![The wall configuration menu](Wall_Config_Menu.png 'The wall configuration menu') Walls can be assigned a top elevation and
a bottom elevation, representing the highest and lowest point of the
wall respectively.

Their values can be edited in the wall configuration menu. To access the
wall configuration menu, double click the wall you wish to modify.

You will now see the Wall Height section at the bottom of the wall
configuration menu. There are two inputs available: `Wall Height (Top)`
and `Wall Height (Bottom)`. The default values are `Infinity` and
`-Infinity` respectively.

## Settings

![The scene setting for Wall Height](Scene_Config_Wall_Height.png 'The scene setting for Wall Height') `Enable Wall Height for Scene` in
scene settings is enabled by default. If you wish to disable it, it can
be done in scene settings. However, this will mean Wall Height's
features cannot be used in the scene.

### Enable Tooltip

![The wall height tooltip](Wall_Height_Tooltip.png 'The wall height tooltip') The tooltip will display when a wall is
hovered, showing its lowest and highest elevation.

### Display Height on Walls

![Display Height on Walls|115x115px](Wall_Height_Display_Value.png 'Display Height on Walls|115x115px') While enabled, displays the
elevation values of a wall on the wall itself.

### Vaulting

Allows for tokens to move over walls at a lower elevation than their
height.

#### Example

Imagine a token at 0 elevation, with a token height of 5, and a 0, 3
Wall

- **Vaulting Enabled**: The movement of the token is not blocked
  because with a height of 5 the token can see over the wall.
- **Vaulting Disabled**: The movement of the token is blocked because
  its elevation (or its feet if you will) is at 0 and the wall blocks
  movement at 0 elevation.

### Automatic Token Height

Calculates the token's height by via token size and scale.

#### Example

A 1x1 token on a 5ft grid would be 5ft tall, a 2x2 token would be 10ft,
and a 1x1 token with a 0.75 scale would be 3.75 ft.

### Default Token Height

The default height of all tokens. Default height is 6. This value is
only used if `Automatic Token Height` is disabled.

### Enable Constrained by Elevation Globally

Area of effect sources will be constrained by walls corresponding the
elevation the source instead of the elevation of the controlled token
while enabled.

### Migrate Wall-Height Data On Startup

Migrates wall-height data from the old wall-height data (pre-4.0)
structure to the new one (4.0+) for users migrating from older versions.

This is only necessary once but you can enable this settings and refresh
the page if you need to run it again.

## Developers

### Elevation Helpers

To avoid data duplication, Wall Height uses a data path belonging to the
[Levels](Levels 'wikilink') module to store it's elevation. If
[Levels](Levels 'wikilink') is not enabled you can use these helpers to
read and set the elevation of a sound or light document.

```js
WallHeight.setSourceElevationTop(document, value);
WallHeight.getSourceElevationTop(document);

WallHeight.setSourceElevationBottom(document, value);
WallHeight.getSourceElevationBottom(document);
```

Or, if you want to set/get both at the same time:

```js
WallHeight.setSourceElevationBounds(document, bottom, top);
WallHeight.getSourceElevationBounds(document);
```

## Other

### Migration to 4.0

Data structures were rewritten in version 4.0 of Wall Height. Scenes and
other entities from pre-4.0 Wall Height require migration.

During the first launch of Wall Height v4.0+, the module will auto
migrate the data on all your scenes and compendiums (this includes token
attacher data).

If you need to migrate the data again, you can always do so by enabling
the setting in the module settings and refreshing. Macros are also
included to run migrations if needed.

#### Content Creator Maps and Prefabs

To manually migrate content with the old data structure:

1. Enable the modules that you wish to migrate (e.g. Baileywiki Maps
   Towns )
2. Unlock **all** the actor compendiums containing Token Attacher
   Prefabs
3. In the Wall Height Macro compendium `Wall Height Macros` run the
   `Wall Height - Migrate Everything` macro
4. In the Token Attacher Macro compendium `Example Macros` run `(TA)
Migrate Actors for Wall Height` and `(TA) Migrate Compendiums for
Wall Height` macros
5. It is now migrated to the new data structure

### Modules

Wall Height is very likely to incompatible with modules which modify
token vision.
