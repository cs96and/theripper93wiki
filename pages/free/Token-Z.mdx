## Auto Sorting

- Elevation: With a maximum priority
- Size: with a weight of -1 (this means a token that is 2x2 will have
  a -4 z-index to it)
- Selected: with a weight of 1 (a selected token will have a +1 z-index
  applied)
- Defeated: with a weight of -1000

## Manual Sorting

Simply input a z-index value in the new field in the token config.
