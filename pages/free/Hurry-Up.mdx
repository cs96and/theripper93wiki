A simple timer to hurry up your players in combat\! Tired of those pesky players
taking forever to then just swing a longsword after a 10 minute wait?

## Features

### Auto Start

The timer automatically starts when it's the turn of a token owned by a
player.

### Critical

Chose the duration of the timer and when it goes critical, at this point
the progress bar will turn red and start blinking.

### Sounds

Play a looping sound when the timer goes critical (defaults to ticking)
and a sound when the time is over.
