# Tile Scroll

Scroll, rotate, and repeat tiles over time.

<Callout type='warning' emoji='⚠️'>
  Tile scroll will not work with tiles with an `Occlusion Mode` of `Radial` or
  `Vision`
</Callout>

## How to use

<ImageButBetter
<<<<<<< HEAD
  src='/public/images/Tile-Scroll/Tsconfiguration.png'
=======
  src='/images/Tile-Scroll/Tsconfiguration.png'
>>>>>>> parent of 08ecb10 (Relinking images)
  alt='Tile Configuration'
  width={2000}
  height={2000}
  className={styles.wikiimage}
/>
You can set all the tile animation parameters in the Animation tab of the tile configuration.

### Enable Scroll and Rotation

Enabling these will enable the animations. You can have both enabled at
the same time or only one of them.

### Direction

The direction in degrees of the scrolling.

### Speed

Speed of the animation, if you want to reverse the animation (for
example rotate in the opposite direction) you can use a negative speed

### Texture Repeat

How many times the texture is tiled. If you wish, you could use Tile
Scroll just for tiling by setting the speed to 0

If you are using rotation, and you don't want the tile to repeat outside
it's bounds, you can set Texture Repeat to 0, keep in mind that due to
how Tile Scroll works you'll need the edge of the texture to be
transparent for the Texture Repeat = 0 to work correctly. This is
unfortunately a limitation of the implementation.

### Rotation Pivot

This pivot represents a percentage of the tile. A pivot of 0.5, 0.5 will
rotate the tile along the Center, while a pivot of 0,0 will rotate along
the top left corner, 1,1 along the bottom right and so on.

### Offset

The offset is also percentage based and works with the same logic as the
pivot.
