#### Spot Player Characters

If enabled the token will spot player characters, pausing the game and
panning on the token when spotting. Only works for Random Patrol

<Callout type='warning' emoji='⚠️'>
  This feature only works with Random Patrol, with Path Patrol the spotting will
  not work

#### Enable Path Patrol

If enabled the token will follow the given path/paths. This option is
mutually exclusive to "Enable Random patrol".

#### Use Multiple paths

If enabled the token will use multiple paths.

#### Patrol Path

The name(s) of the path(s) the token will follow if patrolling paths.

#### Path Node

The node of the path at which the token is currently on. This setting
can be changed to start tokens mid-way through paths.

#### Alerting

When a player is spotted a question mark will appear on top of the enemy
token which will then try to chase the intruder.

After a set time has passed the token will be spotted. You can configure
sad time in the module settings.

If the alert time is set to 0 the character will be immediately spotted.

#### Custom Patrols

You can have a token patrol a specific area by drawing a Polygon or
Rectangle (other shapes are not supported) and in its's text property
call it "Patrol" (upper case P). Any token in that area will patrol only
inside that area

You can also draw a Polygon or Rectangle, and in it's text property
include the word "Path" (upper case P) to select the drawing as a path
for patrolling tokens. You may add to the word, but it must include the
word "Path" somewhere. (eg. GuardPathA, GuardPathB). A token set to
patrol a path will reset back to the beginning of the path once it has
finished unless "Use Multiple Paths" is checked.

The speed for tokens patrolling paths will be determined by the "Patrol
speed for paths(ms)" module setting. This setting defines how long it
will take every token patrolling a path to arrive at the next node.
Thus, the actual animation speed will depend on the distance from the
current node to the next one. This means that tokens can "speed up" mid
path by drawing longer nodes or "slow down" by drawing shorter nodes.

Please ensure that only one of the patrol types is checked in the token
config.

#### Using Multiple Paths

If the "Use Multiple Paths" checkbox is enabled in the token config, You
can draw multiple paths with the same name. The token will randomly
select one of the other paths with the same name when it has finished
patrolling its current path. It will give preference to paths that are
not currently being patrolled by any tokens.

It is often a good idea to hit the "Remap paths and Reset Nodes" button
after making any changes to any paths or patrolling tokens. This will
reset the token's path node to either 0, or to a random path and node
within the group if the "Reset to Random Node" is checked.

## Auto Rotate

Patrol is compatible with the Auto Rotate module. Combine them for auto
rotating patrols\!

## Issues

### Patrol is not working

If patrol is not working, check this steps before opening an issue:

- If a token is selected it will stop patrolling
- If you create a combat encounter the patrol will stop
- If you have the game paused, the patrol will stop
- If you haven't toggled the patrol button the patrol will not start
- If path patrol mode tokens will not spot players

### Integration

You can use Patrol's hooks to enable additional features. Use the hooks:

- `"prePatrolSpotted", (spotter, spotted)`
- `"patrolSpotted", (spotter, spotted)`
- `"prePatrolAlerted", (spotter, spotted)`
- `"patrolAlerted", (spotter, spotted)`

Example:

```js
Hooks.on('prePatrolSpotted', (spotter, spotted) => {
  // Only actually spotted if the Spotter has a higher passive perception than the target's DC
  return spotter.passivePerception >= spotted.passiveDC;
});
```

```js
Hooks.on('patrolSpotted', (spotter, spotted) => {
  // Start a new combat if needed, then add the spotter to the spotted with a surprise round
});
```
