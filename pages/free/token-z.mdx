# Token Z

<ModuleInfo/>

Easily manage the Z-Index of tokens.

## Auto Sorting

<Image
  src='/images/Token-Z/Tzindex.png'
  alt='Z-Index Field'
  
  
  className={styles.wikiimage}
/>

Token-Z is opinionated and will auto sort based on some parameters:

- Elevation: With a maximum priority
- Size: with a weight of -1 (this means a token that is 2x2 will have
  a -4 z-index to it)
- Selected: with a weight of 1 (a selected token will have a +1 z-index
  applied)
- Defeated: with a weight of -1000

## Manual Sorting

Simply input a z-index value in the new field in the token config.

## Pushing Back

If you want to push a token back, you can press the `Z` key (rebindable). The pushing is temporary and refreshing the page or changing scene will restore the automatic sorting.
