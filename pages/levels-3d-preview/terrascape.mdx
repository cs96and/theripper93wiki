# Terrascape

**Terrascape** is a 3D Terrain Sculpting and Painting Tool, you can use it
as a web app at
[https://terrascape.theripper93.com/](https://terrascape.theripper93.com/)

## Getting Started

This section will guide you through setting up a basic project.

### Setting up a New Project

- Open the Terrascape Web-App
  ([https://terrascape.theripper93.com/](https://terrascape.theripper93.com/))
- You will see the `New File` window already opened, set the options
  as desired or leave them as default and press `Confirm`

### Sculpting

- You will be welcomed by the Sculpting interface. To sculpt simply
  click and drag on the Terrain or Right click and drag to invert the
  sculpting direction.
- To switch between the available Sculpting tools, click the
  corresponding icon in the bottom section of the left side Controls
- If you wish to change the view mode of your terrain, click the Top
  button in the left side Controls.

### Painting

- Click the second button from the top in the left side Controls to
  switch to Painting mode
- Before painting you will need to add a texture or material, for this
  example let's use
  [This](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_GivszWvrKMMhqiGaNNvJBodve_4ErIC/view?usp=sharing)
  file. Download it and unzip it somewhere on your device.
- Click the `Add Texture` button (the first button in the Painting
  Tools). A window will open.
- You can click on each individual material channel to upload the
  texture or drag and drop every file individually to each channel. To
  speed up the process, open the folder you downloaded previously,
  select all the textures and drag all of them in any of the channels,
  Terrascape will automatically map them to the correct channel. Once
  the upload is complete, press the `Confirm` button
- Now that a texture has been added, the `Texture panel` will appear
  on the Right side of the interface, you can click any texture to set
  it as the active texture or the trash can to remove it.
- Click and drag on your terrain to paint.
- You can use the 3 Sliders to change some brush settings, in order
  from top to bottom: Brush Strength, Texture Size and Brush Opacity.
- Clicking the `white square` right under the `Add Texture` button
  will let you set a Tint for the texture.
