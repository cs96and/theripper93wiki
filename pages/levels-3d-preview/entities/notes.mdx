# Notes

Notes in 3D Work exactly the same as in 2D.

## 3D Model

The only extra feature available in 3D for Notes is the possibility to set a 3D Model as their icon instead of the default Cube.
To do so, simply open the Note configuration and select the 3D Model you want to use. Below the 3D model field you can also find a rotation slider to adjust the orientation of your 3D Icon.
