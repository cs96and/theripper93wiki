# Walls

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    Since 3D Canvas mostly uses tiles for collision and sight blocking, which offer more flexibility in a 3D environment, it's not possible to place\draw walls in 3D but the walls placed in 2D will be displayed.     
</Callout>

While walls in 3D will work the same as in 2D (they will block sight and collision) it's suggested to use tiles instead as they offer more flexibility and options.

## Customization

It's possible to change some of the walls' properties, such as the color, the opacity, the thickness, and the texture.
To do so, open the Wall configuration (from the 2D View or the Canvas popout) and head to the 3D Tab.
