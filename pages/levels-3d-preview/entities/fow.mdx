## Fog of War

### Shared Context

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  It is **not recommended** to disable Shared Context.
</Callout>

Shared Context is a global setting. If enabled, it allows for fog of war
to be rendered in real-time with better performance and better quality. The downside is that you will lose access to the Mini-Canvas

### Fog Exploration

If you have both **Token Vision** and **Fog Exploration** enabled in the
scene settings, 3D Canvas will mirror the 2D Canvas fog. This means that
fog bounds are solely determined by walls in the scene.

If you have **Token Vision** enabled but **Fog Exploration** disabled, the whole scene will be revealed but walls and geometry (if set in the scene settings) will prevent tokens from seeing each other if blocked by
obstacles.

### Fog Limitations

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  **Fog is not 3D!** Fog exploration is 2 dimensional.
</Callout>

Exploring any space will explore the full vertical space of that location. There are no current plans for 'true' 3D fog exploration because of performance costs.

### Manual Fog of War

If you wish to have some semblance of a 3D Fog, you can use Box Measure
templates to create Fog of War boxes. It will mimic the use a piece of
paper to cover the map table experience—but in 3D.

Simply place a Box Measured Template, open it's configuration, and
enable `Is Fog of War Box`

Players will see this box as solid black. GMs will see it semi
transparent. Moving the camera inside the box will obscure the view. The GM can move or remove these boxes during the exploration.
