## Generating Thumbnails for 3D Files

If you have a folder of your own 3D Models, you can generate Thumbnails
that will be used by Filepicker+ to display. To do so, simply run this
in the console or as a script macro replacing the path accordingly.

```js
game.threeportrait.ThreePortraitPreview.generateThumbnails("your/path/")
```

Example:

```js
game.threeportrait.ThreePortraitPreview.generateThumbnails("assets/3dModels")
```

By default this command will skip generating a thumbnail if it already
exists, if you wish to generate anyways (for example to replace old
thumbnails) you can set the second argument to false

```js
game.threeportrait.ThreePortraitPreview.generateThumbnails("your/path/",
false)
```

Thumbnail generation requires **Chrome** or the **Desktop App**, it won't
work in other browsers\!
