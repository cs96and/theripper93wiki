# 3D Canvas Getting Started

A guide for quickly getting started with [3D Canvas](./).

## First Steps

Ensure you have all the [required modules](./#modules) enabled and installed.

Once you have [3D Canvas](./) and its required modules
enabled, you will now be able to create and view 3D Scenes in Foundry. <br/>
You can enable 3D on any map by pressing the Toggle 3D Mode button <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faCube} /> located under the Token Controls <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faUser} />

This also works for preexisting maps. Enabling 3D Mode will not make any
changes to your original 2D Scene.

## Your First 3D Scene

Now that you are familiar with enabling the 3D Mode, let's make a simple
3D Scene.

### Obtaining a model (Optional)

We will be using [this model](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/arena-game-level-design-2af935c72b0d4e758ef5ad376d0dba32)
as an example for the guide. You can use any other model for this
tutorial.

1. Download the model above or a model of your choice for the scene.
2. Ensure the model is downloaded in or converted to the **GLB** format.
3. When you open the **Tile Browser** while in 3D Mode you will be able to upload 3D Models the same way you would upload an image 

### Creating a 3D Scene

<Callout type='warning' emoji='⚠️'>
  Keep in mind that when you have **Use 3D Geometry for
   Sight Calculations** enabled, vision will not work when the map is in 2D Mode but will only work in 3D!
</Callout>
1. Create a new Scene
2. In the Scene Configuration, under the 3D Tab, enable "**Enable for
   Players**" and "**Enable 3D on Load**" and "**Use 3D Geometry for
   Sight Calculations**" and Save the scene configuration.
3. Enter 3D Mode and navigate to the Tiles Layer, click the Folder icon, browse to your preferred directory
   and upload the downloaded GLB file then Drag n Drop it onto the scene.
   **If you open the File Browser while in 2D Mode it will show images
   instead of 3D Models\!**
4. In your compendiums, in the sidebar, locate the _3D Canvas Macro
   Compendium_, select your tile by clicking on it (a gizmo and an
   orange box or an outline will appear) then run the _Fit Tile To Scene_ Macro.
5. Drag some tokens from the sidebar to the scene and start playing in
   3D\!

## What next?

Now that you are familiar with basic 3D Canvas functionality, it's
highly suggested that you install [3D Canvas Mapmaking Pack](./canvas3dcompendium) and [3D Canvas Token Compendium](./canvas3dtokencompendium) so you have some tiles, tokens and premade scenes to play around with\!

It's also suggested that you install [3D Portraits](./three-actor-portrait) and
[Filepicker+](../premium/filepicker-plus) to get 3D Previews when you hover
over files and [Heroforge](https://www.heroforge.com/) integration! Once that is setup, you can start building your own scenes
by using 3D Tiles!

To get started:

1. Create a new scene, with the same settings as above.
2. Head to the Tiles Layer
3. You will see a controller icon, this will show you a quick reference
   of the tile builder controls, click it.
4. Open the File Browser by clicking the Folder icon and navigate to
   `modules/canvas3dcompendium/assets/Tiles`
5. Choose your preferred assets, drag and drop them onto the scene and
   start building\!

To further enhance your 3D Canvas Experience, you can check the
[Recommended Modules](./#modules).
