# 3D Canvas Particle System

## Creating an Effect

First create a `Script Macro`, then to start creating your effect simply call

```js copy
new Particle3D(type);
```

`type` is the type of particle effect, at the moment the options are:

| Effect     | type         | type(short) |
| ---------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Projectile | "projectile" | "p"         |
| Sprite     | "sprite"     | "s"         |
| Ray        | "ray"        | "r"         |
| Explosion  | "explosion"  | "e"         |

If no type is provided the default is `"p"`

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Note that "Sprite" also accepts 3D Models as particles!
</Callout>

Now you can start chaining properties, similar to how Sequencer works. Every time you call a `.method()` on a `Particle3D` it will always return the `Particle3D` object, allowing for chaining. The only exception is the `.start()` method that will return the ID if the `Particle3D`
First we must provide an origin and a destination.

```js copy
new Particle3D(type).from(origin).to(destination);
```

### `.from()` & `.to()`

These two methods are required on every effects, each one can take a single `Token` or an array of `Tokens` or a single `Position` or an array of them. Non `Token` placeables are also supported.
A `Position` is defined by `{ x:0, y:0, z:0 }` where `z` is in elevation units.
`Explosion` effects are the exception as they do not require a `.from()`

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  You can omit both `.from()` and `.to()` when creating an effect inside
  `.onEnd()`. In that case the `.to()` will be set as the target of that
  particular effect.
</Callout>

Let's set up our origin as the selected token and the destination as our targets

```js copy
new Particle3D(type).from(token).to(Array.from(game.user.targets));
```

At this point we can `.start()` our Particle3D to play the effect and the default settings will be used (it will look like a firebolt)

```js copy /start/
new Particle3D(type).from(token).to(Array.from(game.user.targets)).start();
```

### `.start()`

The `.start()` method takes no arguments and will simply start the effect. After using this method you should **not** interact with the `Particle3D` anymore. Use the returned ID instead if you wish to stop the effect, see the [Stopping an Effect](#stopping-an-effect) section below.

If you wish you can call `.start(false)` to only play the effect locally.

### Stopping an Effect

When creating an effect, the effect will return it's id. You can use this Id later to stop the effect. You can also execute `Particle3D.stop("all")` to stop all effects.

If you used the `.name()` property on effect creation you can also `.stop(name)` to stop all effects with that name.

### Try it yourself

These are several examples showcasing the Particle3D system that are a good starting point for understanding the system and creating your own custom effects.

Create new `Script Macros` in your game with the code blocks below to try them out in 3DCanvas and see the different effects. You can adjust the variables to see how those influence the effects. These macros are also all available to import directly in the `3D Canvas Particle Effects` macro compendium!

Simply select a token, target some tokens and run the macros, you will see them in action!

## Examples

### Frostbolt

```js copy
new Particle3D("p")
  .from(token)
  .to(Array.from(game.user.targets))
  .sprite("modules/levels-3d-preview/assets/particles/star_09.png")
  .speed(10)
  .color("#0f4fff", "#4dd5ff")
  .scale(0.7)
  .start();
```

### Bouncing Frostbolt (onEnd)

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  The `.onEnd()` parameter accepts another `Particle3D`
</Callout>
<Callout type="error" emoji="️🚫">
  You must not call `.start()` on the `Particle3D` inside the `.onEnd()`. The
  Particle3D inside the `.onEnd()` can have an `.onEnd()` as well, allowing for
  infinite chaining.
</Callout>

```js copy /onEnd/
new Particle3D("p")
  .from(canvas.tokens.controlled)
  .to(Array.from(game.user.targets))
  .speed(10)
  .color("#0f4fff", "#4dd5ff")
  .scale(0.8)
  .onEnd(
    new Particle3D("p")
      .from(Array.from(game.user.targets))
      .to(canvas.tokens.controlled)
      .speed(10)
      .color("#0f4fff", "#4dd5ff")
      .scale(0.8)
  )
  .start();
```

### Magic Missile

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  The `.arc()` parameter will make each projectile curve in a different
  direction!
</Callout>

```js copy /arc/
new Particle3D("p")
  .from(token)
  .to(Array.from(game.user.targets))
  .speed(8)
  .repeat(3)
  .arc(1)
  .delay(300)
  .color("#ffffff", "#2e4aff")
  .scale(0.7)
  .start();
```

### Shocking Grasp

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Ray Effects tend to require a larger amount of particles, don't forget to set
  `.rate()`
</Callout>

```js copy /rate/
new Particle3D("r")
  .from(token)
  .to(Array.from(game.user.targets))
  .sprite("modules/levels-3d-preview/assets/particles/spark_04.png")
  .color("blue", "#2e4aff")
  .scale(0.7)
  .rate(100, 1)
  .start();
```

### Scorching Ray

```js copy
new Particle3D("r")
  .from(token)
  .to(Array.from(game.user.targets))
  .sprite("modules/levels-3d-preview/assets/particles/flame_01.png")
  .color("red", "orange")
  .scale(0.5)
  .repeat(3)
  .duration(250)
  .delay(600)
  .rate(100, 1)
  .start();
```

### Dubstep Gun

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  The `.color()` parameter can accept Arrays of colors.
</Callout>

```js copy /color/
new Particle3D("p")
  .from(token)
  .to(Array.from(game.user.targets))
  .sprite("modules/levels-3d-preview/assets/particles/slash_03.png")
  .repeat(3)
  .delay(200)
  .speed(10)
  .color(["red", "blue"], ["green", "yellow"])
  .start();
```

### Fireball Explosion

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Explosion effects do not need a `.from()`. This is the only exception.
</Callout>

```js copy /from/
new Particle3D("e")
  .to(Array.from(game.user.targets))
  .sprite("modules/levels-3d-preview/assets/particles/dust.png")
  .speed(0)
  .color("red", "orange")
  .scale(2, 2)
  .gravity(2)
  .life(700)
  .rate(10, 1)
  .emitterSize(1)
  .alpha(0.1, 0)
  .mass(400)
  .start();
```

### Wall of fire (stop)

Notice how the new `Particle3D()` is assigned to a variable, then a set timeout
stops the effect after 1000 milliseconds. With the same logic you could store
the ID and stop an effect on concentration end.

```js copy /Particle3D/
const effectId = new Particle3D("r")
  .from(token)
  .to(Array.from(game.user.targets))
  .sprite("modules/levels-3d-preview/assets/particles/flame_01.png")
  .color("red", "orange")
  .scale(1.5)
  .duration(Infinity)
  .rate(100, 1)
  .gravity(-5)
  .start();

setTimeout(() => {
  Particle3D.stop(effectId);
}, 1000);
```

### Wall of fire (stop with name)

Once you assign a name you can stop the effect from a completely different macro.

```js copy /Particle3D.stop/
const effectId = new Particle3D("r")
  .from(token)
  .to(Array.from(game.user.targets))
  .sprite("modules/levels-3d-preview/assets/particles/flame_01.png")
  .color("red", "orange")
  .name("Wall of Fire")
  .scale(1.5)
  .duration(Infinity)
  .rate(100, 1)
  .gravity(-5)
  .start();

//In a different macro later on - we stop the effect
Particle3D.stop("Wall of Fire");
```

### Spirit Bolt (Explosion Chaining)

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  The `.to()` is omitted from the `.onEnd()` explosion effect so that the
  explosion plays on the target hit.
</Callout>

```js copy
new Particle3D("p")
  .from(token)
  .to(Array.from(game.user.targets))
  .speed(15)
  .arc(1)
  .color("#c034eb", "#5819b5")
  .scale(1)
  .onEnd(
    new Particle3D("e")
      .sprite("modules/levels-3d-preview/assets/particles/dust.png")
      .speed(0)
      .color("#c034eb", "#291547")
      .scale(0.9, 0.9)
      .gravity(-5)
      .life(1700)
      .force(3)
      .rate(50, 1)
      .emitterSize(0.05)
      .alpha(0.1, 0)
      .mass(200)
  )
  .start();
```

### Magic Missile (MIDI-QOL on use Macro)

```js copy
const lastArg = args[args.length - 1];
const casterToken = canvas.tokens.get(lastArg.tokenId);
const targets = lastArg.hitTargets;
new Particle3D("p")
  .from(casterToken)
  .to(targets)
  .speed(8)
  .repeat(3)
  .arc(1)
  .delay(200)
  .color("#ffffff", "#2e4aff")
  .scale(0.7)
  .start();
```

## Particles Properties & Behaviours

We can now add properties to the effect in any order to alter it's appearance

### `.alpha(start,end)`

This property requires start and end to be numbers between 0 and 1 - sets the starting and ending opacity of particles

### `.arc(integer)`

This property takes an integer and indicates how many times the projectile will curve before reaching it's destination. Default is 0

### `.color(start,end)`

This will determine the starting and ending color of the effect, only start can be provided. start and end can also be arrays of colors (eg `.color([color1,color2],[color3,color4])`.

If an array of colors is provided for start/end the system will pick one of those colors randomly as the starting/ending color - it will **not** create a multicolor gradient.

The colors can be in any format, HEX is recommended but you can use any CSS compatible color - even using `"red"` will work.

### `.delay(milliseconds)`

If `.repeat()` is set, this will be the delay between each repeat.

### `.duration(milliseconds)`

Duration in milliseconds of the effect, valid only for "ray". Default is 300 milliseconds

### `.emitterSize(number)`

Radius of the area of emission in grid squares (so 1 would be 1 grid square), the larger the number the more spread out the particles will be in their starting point. Default is 0

### `.force(number)`

If using an explosion, set the force of the explosion, default is 15.
This will determine the force with which the particles are propelled from the origin. Higher numbers will result in faster particles.

### `.gravity(number)`

Gravity affecting the particles - 1 is Earth gravity.
Higher numbers means particles will travel down faster depending on their mass.
Negative gravity is also possible if you want particles to go up instead.

### `.life(min, max)`

Range in milliseconds of the lifetime of a particle, bigger numbers will equal to longer trails. default (100,500). A single value is also accepted.

### `.mass(number)`

The Mass of the particle, this will affect how much gravity pulls down the particle. Default is 100.

### `.miss()`

If added to the effect, it will miss the target. You can also call `.miss(Boolean)` if you prefer.

### `.name(string)`

You can give a name to an effect, if you do so, you can call the `.stop()` method using this name and all effects with this name will be stopped.

### `.onEnd(particle3D)`

You can pass another particle3D or an array of particle3d to the `.onEnd` method, if you do so, these effects will be played when the main effect ends, you can nest this how many times you want but **DO NOT** call the `.start()` method on Particle3D inside the `.onEnd()` method. Does not trigger when the effect is terminated by `.stop()`

### `.playAnimation(animationData)`

Play a 3D Animation, the animation data is formatted as follows

```js copy
{
  // The from property specifies which animation should be played
  // on the origin of the particle effect (usually the caster or attacker)
  from: {
    // The id of the animation to play
    id: "twirl",
    //If the animation should be played on start of the effect
    start: true,
    // If the animation should be played when the effect ends (like a projectile reaching it's target)
    end: false,
  },
  // The from property specifies which animation should be played
  // on the origin of the particle effect
  // (usually the caster or attacker)
  to: {
    id: "shake",
    start: true,
    end: false,
  },
}
```

### `.push(dx,dy,dz)`

The pushing force affecting the particles, this is a method generally used internally for fixed emitters - it will create an effect on the particles as if a force was pushing them in a specific direction. Default is (0,0,0).

### `.rate(particles,milliseconds)`

The Rate of the emitter, where particles is the amount of particles in the system and milliseconds is how often the system creates a particle. Default (12, 16)

### `.repeat(integer)`

The number of times to repeat the effect

### `.rotation(x,y,z)`

Rotation in degrees of the particle, only used if using a 3D Model as particle

### `.up(x,y,z)`

A unit vector (eg .up(1,0,1) ) representing the direction of the "tip" of the model (eg, an arrow or a dagger), only used if using a 3D Model as particle

### `.rotateTowards()`

Instead of a projectile, do a swinging motion, only used if using a 3D Model as particle

### `.scale(min,max)`

The starting and ending size in in grid squares of a single particle. Default is (0.8,0)

### `.speed(number)`

The speed of the projectile. Default is 10.

### `.sprite(pathToFile)`

The path to the image to be used as particle. Default is `modules/levels-3d-preview/assets/particles/emberssmall.png` you can find many particles in that same folder.

### `.startAfter(milliseconds)`

Delay the start of the effect by the specified milliseconds
