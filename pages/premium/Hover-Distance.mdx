# Hover Distance

Show distance to a token when hovering it. ![Hovering a single
token](Hdsingle.png "Hovering a single token")

## How to use

Hover a token while having a token selected to show the distance to that
token ![Holding ALT to highlight all tokens](Hdmasshighlight.png
"Holding ALT to highlight all tokens") Hold `ALT` to highlight all
visible tokens and show the distance to all of them

## Customization

You can decide when the distance is shown (eg. only in combat) and other
smaller tweaks in the module settings.

## Measurements

Keep in mind that due to the calculation beeing not possible, if two
tokens are at a different elevation, the distance mesurement will be
switched from your preferred method to `Euclidean`
