# Media Optimizer

<ModuleInfo/>

Automatically optimize images, audio and video on upload.

### How to use

<Callout type='warning' emoji='⚠️'>
  This module will only work on Chromium based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc) and the Foundry VTT Desktop App.
</Callout>

This module will automatically convert any images, audio and video you upload into foundry to WEBP, WEBM and OGG, it also has the ability to downscale the image.

You can configure compression and downscaling in the module settings. By default images will be compressed with a 0.75 ratio and kept at a maximum resolution of 8K, images above that resolution are not downscaled.

### Audio\Video Conversion

For the audio\video conversion to work, you need to create a shortcut to the chrome browser and add the ` --enable-features=SharedArrayBuffer` flag at the end of it.

The `target` of your shortcut should look something like this:

```
"C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --enable-features=SharedArrayBuffer
```

#### Audio\Video Conversion Time

Time for conversion can vary, but as a rule of thumb, it takes about 2 minutes to convert 1 hour of audio and 10 minutes to convert 1 minute of video.

If you wish, you can open the console (F12) and watch the conversion progress.

#### Audio\Video Compression

The audio compression will depend on the original file, but it should be around 50% of the original size.

The video compression will depend on the original file, but it should be around 10% of the original size.
