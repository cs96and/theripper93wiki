# Media Optimizer

<ModuleInfo/>

Automatically optimize images on upload.

### How to use

<Callout type='warning' emoji='⚠️'>
  This module will only work on Chromium based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc) and the Foundry VTT Desktop App.
</Callout>

This module will automatically convert any image you upload into foundry to webp, it also has the ability to downscale the image.

You can configure compression and downscaling in the module settings. By default images will be compressed with a 0.75 ratio and kept at a maximum resolution of 8K, images above that resolution are not downscaled.

The module also has an experimental audio converter that will convert audio files to OGG (note EXPERIMENTAL, might not work)

### Audio Conversion

For the audio conversion to work, you need to create a shortcut to the chrome browser and add the ` --enable-features=SharedArrayBuffer` flag at the end of it.

The `target` of your shortcut should look something like this:

```
"C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --enable-features=SharedArrayBuffer
```

#### Audio Conversion Time

Time for conversion can vary, but as a rule of thumb, it takes about 2 minutes to convert 1 hour of audio.

If you wish, you can open the console (F12) and watch the conversion progress.
