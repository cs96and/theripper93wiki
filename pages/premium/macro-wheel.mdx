# Macro Wheel

<ModuleInfo/>

Do you have too many macros? Macro Wheel is for you\! Press `M` or
`Middle Mouse Button` to show an easy to use interface that can hold
infinite macros\!

## Getting Started

<Image src="/images/Macro-Wheel/Macrowheel.png" alt="Macro Wheel in action"   className={styles.wikiImageSmall}/>

When you enable the module it will be already ready to go, simply press
M to display your macros in the Macro Wheel\! This said, a warning will
be shown prompting you to setup the macro wheel since the `MacroWheel`
folder is missing.

If you don't wish to do any specific configuration for Macro Wheel,
simply head into the module settings and enable `Use Root Folder`.

### Basic Configuration

<Image src="/images/Macro-Wheel/Macrowheelsample.png" alt="A sample setup of folders and subfolders"   className={styles.wikiImage}/>

If `Use Root Folder` is
disabled, Macro Wheel will build the wheel using a folder named
`MacroWheel`, let's set it up\!

- Open the `Macros Directory`
- Create a folder named exactly `MacroWheel`
- Every folder inside the `MacroWheel` folder will create a `Wheel`
    containing all the macros inside that folder, you can check the
    image to see how a sample setup looks like

### Customizing the Wheel

Every `Wheel` is a `macro folder`, so to customize it, simply edit the
folder. If you prefer, you can open the edit folder dialog by clicking
with the `right mouse button` on a wheel.

You will find 2 extra options

#### Macro Wheel Image

This is the image used for the Wheel, change it to what you prefer\!

#### Condition

Some premade conditions you can use to conditionally show a wheel. For
example selecting `In Combat` will only show the wheel if a combat is
active in the scene. Set to `Custom` to use the option below.

#### Custom Condition

This is a condition that will be evaluated to determine if the wheel
should be shown, for example you could use the `canvas.activeLayer ===
canvas.tokens` condition to have the specific Wheel display only on the
token layer.

### Other Customizations

The module settings contains other customizations that are explained in
the setting itself, such as showing hotbars and customizing the macro
wheel size\!
