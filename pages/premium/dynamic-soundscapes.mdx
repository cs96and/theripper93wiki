# Dynamic Soundscapes
<ModuleInfo/>

Create dynamic soundscapes with an easy and organized interface.

## How to use

The first time you activate the module, a `Soundscape` folder will be created. All the soundscapes you create must be stored there for the module to recognize them.

### Opening the interface

To open the interface, click on the `Dynamic Soundscapes` button in the Sidebar Playlist tab. Alternatively, you can use the `Shift + S` shortcut.

### Creating a soundscape

Soundscapes are just regular playlists with some extra processing done by the module, you can simply create a playlist in the `Soundscape` folder or use the `New Soundscape` button in the interface.

### Adding sounds to a soundscape

To add sounds to a soundscape, click on the `Cog` button in the interface to open the Playlist configuration where you can Bulk Import, or click on the `+` button to add a single sound.

### Blocks
Blocks are an imporant part of Dynamic Soundscapes, they are container for your sounds and can be configured in different ways, by default sounds will be placed in the `Orphaned` block.

#### Creating a Block

To create a block, simply click on an empty space in the interface. A new block will be created.

#### Organizing

You can drag and drop blocks to organize them, you can also drag and drop sounds from one block to another.

#### Configuring

To open the Block configuration, click on the `Cog` button in the block header. In this window you can configure the block name, type and color.

#### Enabling Sounds

`Ambient` and `Random` blocks require sounds to be enabled, in order to enable a sound, simply click on it. You can click again to disable it.

#### Block types

There are 3 types of blocks:

- `Ambient` - Ambient blocks will play all enabled sounds inside them at the same time, they are useful for creating a background ambience.
- `Random` - Random blocks will play a random sound inside them chosen between the enabled sounds, they are useful for creating a more dynamic soundscape. You can set the frequency of the random sounds by setting the Time in the Block configuration.
- `Soundboard` - Soundboard blocks will play a single sound inside them, you cannot enable sounds in a soundboard block, instead, clicking a sound will play it.
 
### Playing a soundscape

When a Soundscape is in the `Stopped` state, all sounds from that soundscape will be stopped, and none can be played.
To play a soundscape click on the `Play` button to the right of the soundscape name.

When a soundscape is in the `Playing` state, the following will happen:

- All enabled sounds from `Ambient` blocks will be played at the same time and loop.
- Random sounds from `Random` blocks will be played at the frequency set in the block configuration.
- You will be able to play sounds from `Soundboard` blocks by clicking on them.
