- Drag and Drop ingredients in the **+** panels. Dragging multiple
  ingredients in the same panel will let the player chose which one to

### Timed Crafting

<Callout type='warning' emoji='⚠️'>
  To avoid checking all actors on a regular basis which would cause network slowdowns and server strain, timed crafting will be processed whenever you open an actor sheet for that actor only.
</Callout>

Recipes accept a time option, which is time in minutes. Keep in mind that this option will work based on world time so you will need some other module that handles time passing for it to work.
Such modules include [Simple Calendar](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/foundryvtt-simple-calendar) and/or [Small Time](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/smalltime).

If you wish to manually process timed crafting, you can use this macro.

```javascript numberLines copy
ui.RecipeApp.processDelayedCrafting(Array.from(game.actors).filter(a => a.isOwner))
```

### Advanced: Adding conditions to crafting

Adding conditions will allow you to add custom checks to crafting, for
example making a strength check in order to make an item (in addition to
other conditions). We will use the DND5E System in this example but it
will work with any system, refer to your system discord channel or macro
polo to know the correct macro commands for checks.

- Create a new script macro, for this example we will call it
  `StrengthCheck`
- Edit the recipe and type the exact macro name in the `Condition`
  field
- The macro will need to return an object `{ success: Boolean,
consume: Boolean }`
- `success` determines if the crafting is successful or not while
  `consume` determines if the ingredients are consumed in the event of
  a failed craft
- In the context of the macro, `actor` is the Actor doing the
  crafting.
- You can copy paste this sample macro to use as a template for your
  own
- Note: You can also copy paste the macro code directly in the
  `Condition` field, but make sure your lines correctly end with `;`
  as the code will be collapsed to a single line!

#### Example: Ability Test
This macro for DnD5e shows how you can make a strength check and return the result. If the check is successful, the crafting will be successful and the ingredients will be consumed. If the check fails, the crafting will fail and the ingredients will still be consumed.
```javascript numberLines copy
const roll = await actor.rollAbilityTest('str');

return {
  success: roll.total > 12,
  consume: true,
};
```

#### Example: Tool Check
This macro for DnD5e shows how you can make a tool check and return the result. If the check is successful, the crafting will be successful and the ingredients will be consumed. If the check fails, the crafting will fail and the ingredients will still be consumed.

```javascript numberLines copy
const toolName = "Alchemist's Supplies";
const DC = 12;

const tool = actor.items.getName(toolName);
const result = await tool.rollToolCheck();
return  {
    success: result.total >= DC,
    consume: true
};
```

#### Example: Require and Consume a Spellslot
This macro for DnD5e shows how you can check if the actor has a spellslot and consume it if they do. If they don't have a spellslot, it will show an error message and prevent the crafting from happening.
```javascript numberLines copy
const hasSpellslot = actor.system.spells.spell1.value > 0;
if(!hasSpellslot){
ui.notifications.error("No Spellslot")
    return {
        success: false,
        consume: false,
    };
}
await actor.update({'system.spells.spell1.value': actor.system.spells.spell1.value - 1});

return {
    success: true,
    consume: true,
}
```
