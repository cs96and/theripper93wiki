### Opening the Config Presets window

To open the Config Presets window, simply click on it's icon in the
scene controls. The list of presets is filtered based on the layer you
are on, for example if you are on the Walls layer, only walls presets
will be shown.

### Creating a preset

To create a preset, first select an object (for example a wall) then click on the
`+` button in the config presets window header.

Note that some placeables cannot be selected, for this reason you will
not be able to select (for example) lights, to do so, it's reccomended
to install the module [Select Tool
Everywhere](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/select-tool-everywhere)

### Editing a preset

After creating a preset, it will appear on the list, from here you can
edit the preset.

#### Editing the name

By default, the name of a preset will be the Id of the object used to
create the preset, to change it, simply right click on the name and it
will become editable. After editing press Enter or Right Click to
confirm your changes.

#### Duplicating

The first icon in the preset will let you duplicate that preset.

#### Editing the data of the Preset

If you don't want to keep all the data from that preset (for example you might only want the flags from the wall, that contain height data from wall height) you can remove unnecessary data by clicking the edit button
located left of the delete button. By clicking the checked icon near to each data property you can remove it.

Note that by default config presets will exclude some properties from
the presets, such as position, radius and other. If you wish to keep all
properties and manually remove the ones you prefer, you can change this
behaviour in the module settings.

#### Deleting

To remove a preset, simply click the trash can icon.

### Using a preset

To use a preset, first select it by clicking on it, it's background will
turn cyan. Once a preset is selected you have two options:

#### Creating new Objects

With a preset selected, creating new objects will apply the properties
of the preset to that object. For example if your preset is a green
light with an animation, creating lights will make them green with that
animation but it will keep the size of the light as you placed it.

#### Apply a preset to selected objects

With a preset selected and one or more objects selected, click the
button to the Right of the `+` button to apply the selected preset to
all selected objects.
