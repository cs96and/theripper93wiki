## How to use

### With Midi-QoL

If you have Midi-QoL in use, RPG Damage Numbers will automatically show
colored damage numbers whenever a creature is damaged. ![Module
Settings|519x519px](Rdnsettings.png 'Module Settings|519x519px')

### Without Midi-QoL

If you are not using Midi-QoL, RPG Damage numbers will still display
it's own custom animation for status effects and damage numbers, but
color will not be shown for different damage types.
