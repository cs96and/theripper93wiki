# Image Context

<ModuleInfo/>

Create image popouts of any image.

## How to use

<ImageButBetter src="/images/Image-Context/Icmenu.png" alt="Image Context Menu" width={2000} height={2000} className={styles.wikiimage}/>

### Invoking the Image Context Menu

Simply right click on any image in the interface to open the Image
Context Menu, if the item has already a context menu, Right click two
times

This works on any image, this includes:

- Images in sidebar items (Right click two times)
- Images in the file picker
- Images in character, items, journal sheets
- Images in chat messages

#### Show

<ImageButBetter src="/images/Image-Context/Icbutton.png" alt="Image Context Scene controls button" width={2000} height={2000} className={styles.wikiimage}/>

The Show button will popout the
image, from here you can use the regular foundry interactions, such as
show to players

#### Send to chat

This will open a prompt that will let you chose which players can see
the chat message. The image will be posted to chat. Any image created
this way, can be popped out from the chat by left clicking on the image.

#### Copy URL

This will let you copy the image path, to (for example) paste it on a
tile or token image field or anywhere else.

### Chat image parsing

Image context will also parse image URLs posted in chat, so if you send
an image url into chat the image will be shown and it can be popped out
by left clicking.

### URL Parser

The button in the tile layer will let you execute the context menu
operations on a copied URL.
