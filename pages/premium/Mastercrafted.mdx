### Advanced: Adding conditions to crafting

Adding conditions will allow you to add custom checks to crafting, for
example making a strength check in order to make an item (in addition to
other conditions). We will use the DND5E System in this example but it
will work with any system, refer to your system discord channel or macro
polo to know the correct macro commands for checks.

- Create a new script macro, for this example we will call it
  `StrengthCheck`
- Edit the recipe and type the exact macro name in the `Condition`
  field
- The macro will need to return an object `{ success: Boolean,
consume: Boolean }`
- `success` determines if the crafting is successful or not while
  `consume` determines if the ingredients are consumed in the event of
  a failed craft
- In the context of the macro, `actor` is the Actor doing the
  crafting.
- You can copy paste this sample macro to use as a template for your
  own
- Note: You can also copy paste the macro code directly in the
  `Condition` field, but make sure your lines correctly end with `;`
  as the code will be collapsed to a single line!

```javascript numberLines
const roll = await actor.rollAbilityTest('str');

return {
  success: roll.total > 12,
  consume: true,
};
```
