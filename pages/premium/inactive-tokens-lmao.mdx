# Inactive Tokens

<ModuleInfo/>

Disable token interactions.

## How to use

<Image src="/images/Inactive-Tokens/Itbutton.png" alt="Lock button in the token HUD"   className={styles.wikiImage}/>

### Setting a token as inactive

To set a token as inactive, right click on the token to open the HUD and
click the lock button, if you have multiple tokens selected they will
all be set as inactive\\active.

### Set defeated to inactive

By default, Inactive Tokens will set defeated tokens to inactive. You
can change this behaviour in the module settings.

## What's the "Inactive" state?

When a token is in the Inactive state the following will apply:

- The token cannot be selected
- The token will not trigger hover events (such as highlighting or
    changing the mouse pointer)
- The token cannot be moved
- The token cannot be targeted

As a gm, you can still right click on the token to disable the inactive
state, but players will not be able to right click (and trigger the HUD)
