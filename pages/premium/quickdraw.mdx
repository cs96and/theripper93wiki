the drawing will be in your user color and will be displayed live to all
players.

The drawing will disappear after a set time.

In the module settings you can set the time after a drawing fades out.
By default it's 10 Seconds. You can also tweak some other parameters

It's also possible to rebind the default Quickdraw key.
