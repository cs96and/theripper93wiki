# Premium Modules Megapack

This is a zip file that includes all the currently available premium modules. By having a single file it will be quicker
to perform updates and it will be easier to install the modules.

To install the full Megapack, simply follow the same instructions as if it was an individual module. [Click here for install instructions](https://theripper93.com/info/installation).
