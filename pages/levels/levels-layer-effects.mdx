# Levels - Depth Blur

<ModuleInfo/>

**Depth Blur** _(Levels - Depth Blur in releases)_ is a submodule of
[Levels](Levels 'wikilink'). Applies a blur effect to layers in and
tokens depending on the current elevation. The farther you are from a
level, the more blurrier it will be.

## How to use

<Image
  src='/images/Levels-Depth-Blur/Depthblurconfig.png'
  alt='Depth Blur Configuration'
  
  
  className={styles.wikiimage}
/>

- Open the scene configuration
- Head to the Ambience tab
- In the bottom, check `Enable Levels Automatic Blur`
- If you wish, configure the Blur Factor as you like

If your map is configured with Levels and you have a `token selected`
you will see that images will be blurred depending on the distance from
them.
