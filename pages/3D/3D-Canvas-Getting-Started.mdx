A guide for quickly getting started with [3D
Canvas](3D_Canvas "wikilink").

## First Steps

Ensure you have all the [required
modules](3D_Canvas#Required_Modules "wikilink") enabled and installed.

Once you have [3D Canvas](3D_Canvas "wikilink") and its required modules
enabled, you will now be able to create and view 3D Scenes in Foundry.
You can enable 3D on any map by pressing the Toggle 3D Mode button
<i class="fas fa-cube"></i> located under the Token Controls <i class="fas fa-user"></i>

This also works for preexisting maps. Enabling 3D Mode will not make any
changes to your original 2D Scene.

section](3D_Canvas#Controls "wikilink")\!*

## Your First 3D Scene

Now that you are familiar with enabling the 3D Mode, let's make a simple
3D Scene.

### Obtaining a model (Optional)

We will be using [this
model](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/arena-game-level-design-2af935c72b0d4e758ef5ad376d0dba32)
as an example for the guide. You can use any other model for this
tutorial.

1.  Download the model above or a model of your choice for the scene.
2.  Ensure the model is downloaded in or converted to the **GLTF**
    format.
3.  Extract the downloaded folder and copy (or upload if on remote
    hosting) the folder to your Foundry VTT user data
      - At the moment it's not possible to upload 3D Models directly in
        Foundry, but this should be possible with V10.
      - If using the model linked above, the folder will be named
        *`arena_-_game_level_design`*

### Creating a 3D Scene

1.  Create a new Scene
2.  In the Scene Configuration, under the 3D Tab, enable "**Enable for
    Players**" and "**Enable 3D on Load**" and "**Use 3D Geometry for
    Sight Calculations**" and Save the scene configuration.
3.  Enter 3D Mode and navigate to the Tiles Layer, click the Folder icon
    and browse to the `scene.gltf` file. Drag n Drop it onto the scene.
    **If you open the File Browser while in 2D Mode it will show images
    instead of 3D Models\!**
4.  In your compendiums, in the sidebar, locate the *3D Canvas Macro
    Compendium*, select your tile by clicking on it (a gizmo and an
    orange box will appear) then run the *Fit Tile To Scene* Macro.
5.  Drag some tokens from the sidebar to the scene and start playing in
    3D\!

## What next?

Now that you are familiar with basic 3D Canvas functionality, it's
highly suggested that you install [3D Canvas Mapmaking
Pack](https://github.com/theripper93/canvas3dcompendium) and [3D Canvas
Token
Collection](https://github.com/theripper93/canvas3dtokencompendium) so
you have some tiles, tokens and premade scenes to play around with\!

It's also suggested that you install [3D
Portraits](3D_Portraits "wikilink") and
[Filepicker+](Filepicker+ "wikilink") to get 3D Previews when you hover
over files\! Once that is setup, you can start building your own scenes
by using 3D Tiles\! To get started:

1.  Create a new scene, with the same settings as above.
2.  Head to the Tiles Layer
3.  You will see a controller icon, this will show you a quick reference
    of the tile builder controls, click it.
4.  Open the File Browser by clicking the Folder icon and navigate to
    `modules/canvas3dcompendium/assets/Tiles`
5.  Choose your preferred assets, drag and drop them onto the scene and
    start building\!
