Window](3dpconfig.png '3D Portraits Configuration Window')

### Setting a 3D file as actor or item portrait

- Open the 3D Portraits configuration in the Window Header
- In the configuration window select a 3D File, only `glb` and `gltf`
  are supported. If you have setup the Heroforge integration, you can
  use the Heroforge Browser to select a mini from your Heroforge
  Collection
- If you wish set a background image for the 3D Portrait

### Integrations

#### Hero Forge

Accepting the Terms of Services via enabling the respective option in
the module settings is required for Hero Forge integration. It is also
required to input the Hero Forge authentication key in the module
settings. ![Filepicker+ integration](3dpfilepickerplus.png 'Filepicker+ integration')

#### Filepicker+ Integration

If you have Filepicker+ installed you can preview 3D Files directly in
the Filepicker by hovering over them. ![Argon Combat HUD

#### 3D Canvas Integration

If you have 3D Canvas installed, you can use the Heroforge Browser for
3D Tokens

## Generating Thumbnails for 3D Files

If you have a folder of your own 3D Models, you can generate Thumbnails
that will be used by Filepicker+ to display. To do so, simply run this
in the console or as a script macro replacing the path accordingly.

`game.threeportrait.ThreePortraitPreview.generateThumbnails("your/path/")`

Example:

`game.threeportrait.ThreePortraitPreview.generateThumbnails("assets/3dModels")`

By default this command will skip generating a thumbnail if it already
exists, if you wish to generate anyways (for example to replace old
thumbnails) you can set the second argument to false

`game.threeportrait.ThreePortraitPreview.generateThumbnails("your/path/",
false)`

Thubnail generation requires **Chrome** or the **Desktop App**, it won't
work in other browsers\!
