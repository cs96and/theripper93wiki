# Townscaper

[Townscaper](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1291340/Townscaper/) is
a steam game that can be used to algorithmically create towns with
colored blocks of houses on an irregular grid. Towns created using
Townscaper can be exported and retextured using Blender for use in [3D Canvas](./3D-Canvas).

This guide outlines the steps required to do so.

## Creating & exporting a town in Townscaper

Creating a town in Townscaper simply involves selecting a color from the
color palette and clicking on the canvas to place paths and houses. Once
a town has been created, expand the settings by clicking on the cogwheel
in the top-right corner of the screen. Click the "Export .OBJ" button
(only available on PC) to export the town mesh and texture models to a
folder of your choice.

## Importing & retexturing the .obj model in blender

Download & open ![this .blend file]() in
Blender. Once loaded, delete everything in the scene, by clicking on all
the objects in the outliner panel, on the right, and pressing the
`delete` key on your keyboard.

Next, import the .obj model you created with Townscaper by navigating to
File \> Import \> Wavefront(.obj).

**When importing your .obj model, expand the Geometry options on the
right-hand pane and check the "Split by Group" checkbox.**

Once your model has been imported, locate and delete the object named
Water from the outliner panel on the right. There are better water
textures & shaders available for use within 3D Canvas and hence this
mesh has not been retextured.

In the original Townscaper game the doors and windows are inset, in
order to get a similar effect do the following:

- Flip the normals of all the windows \[Select Windows (in the
    outliner panel) -\> Go into edit mode (tab) -\> Open the normals
    menu (Alt + N) -\> Click "Flip"\]
- Add a boolean modifier to the House object \[Select House (in the
    outliner panel) -\> Click modifier properties (the wrench
    icon along the right panel) -\> Add Modifier -\> Boolean\], set to
    difference and within the Object field select Windows.
- Press `Ctrl` + `A` to apply the modifier to House
- Delete the windows object.
- You may either want to set the house to shade flat (right-click -\>
    Shade Flat) or add an edge split modifier, your choice.

After correcting the House mesh to include doors and windows, click
through each remaining object (Birds, Fencing, House, Plants, Props,
Sand) in your scene, with the outliner, navigate to the material
properties panel, and replace the material named Town with the one named
TownCombined, as shown in the image.

Once all the objects have been set to the same material, click on the UV
editing tab along the top of your blender window to change your active
workspace. Press `Tab` on your keyboard to go into object mode. Hover
your cursor over the 3D viewport on the right and press `A` on your
keyboard to select all objects. Then press `Tab` again to toggle back
into edit mode, having selected all remaining meshes in your scene.

Next, hover your cursor on the UV editor panel on the left. Press `A` to
select the entire UV unwrap. Press `S` followed by `X` and then type
0.0625, to scale your selection in the X-axis by a factor of 0.0625.

After scaling the UV unwrap it needs to be translated to the correct
position for retexturing. This is the most difficult step as the amount
of translation needed varies from model to model. The steps to do this
involve hovering your cursor on the UV editor panel, pressing `A` to
select the entire UV unwrap, press `G` followed by `X` and then the
necessary translation amount for your model. The translation amount is
always negative and it varies from model to model, try translating until
the door triangles are all correctly positioned on the leftmost corner
of the texture. This is shown in more detail below:

Your Townscape model is now retextured using Principled BSDF materials.
To use this model in 3D Canvas, go to File \> Export \> glTF 2.0
(.glb/.gltf).
