== Getting Started ==
When you enable the module it will be already ready to go, simply press M to display your macros in the Macro Wheel! This said, a warning will be shown prompting you to setup the macro wheel since the <code>MacroWheel</code> folder is missing.

If you don't wish to do any specific configuration for Macro Wheel, simply head into the module settings and enable <code>Use Root Folder</code>.

=== Basic Configuration ===
[[File:Macrowheelsample.png|thumb|A sample setup of folders and subfolders]]
If <code>Use Root Folder</code> is disabled, Macro Wheel will build the wheel using a folder named <code>MacroWheel</code>, let's set it up!

* Open the <code>Macros Directory</code>
* Create a folder named exactly <code>MacroWheel</code>
* Every folder inside the <code>MacroWheel</code> folder will create a <code>Wheel</code> containing all the macros inside that folder, you can check the image to see how a sample setup looks like

=== Customizing the Wheel ===
Every <code>Wheel</code> is a <code>macro folder</code>, so to customize it, simply edit the folder. If you prefer, you can open the edit folder dialog by clicking with the <code>right mouse button</code> on a wheel.

You will find 2 extra options

==== Macro Wheel Image ====
This is the image used for the Wheel, change it to what you prefer!

==== Condition ====
Some premade conditions you can use to conditionally show a wheel. For example selecting <code>In Combat</code> will only show the wheel if a combat is active in the scene. Set to <code>Custom</code> to use the option below.

==== Custom Condition ====
This is a condition that will be evaluated to determine if the wheel should be shown, for example you could use the <code>canvas.activeLayer === canvas.tokens</code> condition to have the specific Wheel display only on the token layer.

=== Other Customizations ===
The module settings contains other customizations that are explained in the setting itself, such as showing hotbars and customizing the macro wheel size!
