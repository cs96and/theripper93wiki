==== Deep Folder Search ====
If enabled, it will allow you to search in subfolders while using the file picker.

For this feature to work you must enable <code>Deep File Search</code> in the module settings then click the <code>Rebuild Cache</code> button in the settings sidebar

==== Fuzzy Search ====
Fuzzy Searches are done automatically. It will find the closest matches to your search (e.g. searching for accolite will show "Acolyte" in the results). They are enabled by default and will work for compendiums and the actor sidebar.

==== Deep Search ====
The deep search starts with <code>&</code>. It will look into the items to find a property or value that matches the search. For example: Searching for the name of an image will filter for any entity that is using that image. 

Note that this feature works on all sidebar directories and will search inside the JSON itself. If you are looking for a scene with zombies you can search in your scene sidebar for <code>&zombie</code>.

==== Prop Search ====
Starting a search with <code>!</code> will search in the properties defined in the settings. '''Prop Search may be slow for huge directories.'''
If <code>data.details.cr</code> is a property defined in the settings, searching for <code>!1</code> will filter for creatures with a cr of 1.
