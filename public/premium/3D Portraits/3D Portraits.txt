* In the configuration window select a 3D File, only <code>glb</code> and <code>gltf</code> are supported. If you have setup the Heroforge integration, you can use the Heroforge Browser to select a mini from your Heroforge Collection
* If you wish set a background image for the 3D Portrait

=== 3D Canvas Integration ===
If you have 3D Canvas installed, you can use the Heroforge Browser for 3D Tokens

== Generating Thumbnails for 3D Files ==
If you have a folder of your own 3D Models, you can generate Thumbnails that will be used by Filepicker+ to display. To do so, simply run this in the console or as a script macro replacing the path accordingly.

<code>game.threeportrait.ThreePortraitPreview.generateThumbnails("your/path/")</code>

Example:

<code>game.threeportrait.ThreePortraitPreview.generateThumbnails("assets/3dModels")</code>

By default this command will skip generating a thumbnail if it already exists, if you wish to generate anyways (for example to replace old thumbnails) you can set the second argument to false

<code>game.threeportrait.ThreePortraitPreview.generateThumbnails("your/path/", false)</code>

Thubnail generation requires '''Chrome''' or the '''Desktop App''', it won't work in other browsers!
